I‚Äôve wanted to move abroad for years, and my family was originally supportive, offering to help with around **400,000‚Äì500,000 RMB (\~$55,000‚Äì70,000 USD)** for my education. But recently, they suddenly changed their minds ‚Äî now I feel stuck, and I‚Äôm not sure what options I still have.

My background:

* Graduated from a 3-year college in China 3 years ago (associate degree)
* Recently completed a self-taught bachelor‚Äôs degree (to meet the requirements for a master‚Äôs abroad)
* Planned to study computer science abroad, get a master‚Äôs, then find a job and stay
* Have been stuck at IELTS 6.0, which caused me to miss deadlines for schools I really wanted (especially in Denmark)
* Applied last-minute to two universities in the German-speaking region of Switzerland (also computer science), hoping I could improve my German and eventually work in Germany ‚Äî but haven‚Äôt heard back yet

What went wrong:

Now I‚Äôm facing pressure both inside and outside:

1. Internally**:** My study plans got delayed due to language scores. I missed key deadlines and still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get accepted by the Swiss universities.
2. Externally**:** My mom suddenly became extremely anxious about me going abroad, especially as a woman. Relatives keep telling her that ‚Äúabroad is dangerous,‚Äù ‚Äúforeign degrees are useless,‚Äù etc., and she‚Äôs now completely against it. My dad used to support me, but after endless arguments at home, he‚Äôs given up too.

My dilemma:

I still really want to move abroad in the next 1‚Äì2 years. But now:

* I don‚Äôt have strong technical skills or job experience
* My family has withdrawn both emotional and financial support
* I‚Äôm not sure if the ‚Äústudy master‚Äôs ‚Üí job ‚Üí stay‚Äù route is still possible for me
* I don‚Äôt know what other **low-cost, low-barrier** options might exist

Question:

Are there any other realistic pathways people like me (young, limited work experience, non-STEM elite, little support) have taken to get out?

Examples I‚Äôm considering but know little about:

* Work holiday visa (seems hard for Chinese passport?)
* Volunteering programs
* Au pair or cultural exchange
* Language assistant jobs
* Other unconventional paths?

I‚Äôm currently majoring in psychology at a small private university in Switzerland. It‚Äôs super expensive and honestly, the academics have revealed themselves to be repugnant. I originally wanted to major in chemistry or astrophysics, but the school only offers two science majors, including psychology.  I was planning to minor in math, but the university makes it almost impossible to graduate in 4 years, so I decided against it. I‚Äôm on the pre-med track and hope to graduate in 3 years. I came in with credits and plan to take summer courses back in the States to make this happen. After graduation, I plan to take a year off to conduct research and then pursue an MD/PhD.  
  
The problem is that to continue here, I‚Äôll have to take out huge private loans. Sallie Mae is the only lender for international schools, and I‚Äôve already taken out a $36,000 private loan that my family isn‚Äôt paying for, so it‚Äôll just keep growing until I graduate. I come from a single-income household and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Side note I am trapped in a labrynth of suffering being at this school. It is like each person I meet here is a parody version of different variations of rich kids. I was also violently sexually assaulted the second week I was here and have been ostracized since. Anywho. I thought I‚Äôd get more aid, but the longer I‚Äôm here, the more I realize this university won‚Äôt give me more aid and actively attempts to keep students for a 5th year to make more money.

1kblccg,Ill_Nobody_2726,The Swiss University System compared to other countries',"Hey there.

Swiss-born undergrad law student here. I have felt the need to rant about my country's university system for a while so I guess I will do it on this subreddit. Sorry about this long rant but it should be cathartic to me.

I graduated high School as the valedictorian with the best GPA of all students at my school 5.71/6.0 (18,84/20). I wanted to pursue a career in investment banking or venture capital. To do that, in Switzerland, it is almost a requirement to go to HSG St.Gallen. Everyone can get into the school but the issue is that you have to find an accommodation on your own. There is no campus accommodation. With the Swiss logement crisis there are very few apartment available which shoot the rent price up. I come from a working class family, there is no way we can afford a full rent for a studio but we are not poor enough to access emergency funds. I wouldn't want for my family to pay anyway. It seems that in most countries you can either get a merit-based scholarship or take a loan. Also, I have social anxiety so living with strangers in WG scares me a lot and it is barely cheaper.

In Switzerland, student loans are not practiced and merit-based scholarships are non-existent. So I had to give up my dream just because I couldn't afford it and it sucks. People in my high school who barely graduated can go there and not me. It just pisses me off. I feel like I worked so hard in high school and it paid off to nothing whereas were I born somewhere else I would have been more successful.

I hate that in Switzerland everyone is just expected to go to their state school, I feel like in most other countries it is common to have top-tier universities and students from all the country go there. Like what's the point of working so hard in high school if it is not to go to the best university possible. I disincentives excellence. Also, I am 23. I don't wanna live with my parents nor stay in my city but I don't have the choice. I work part time in customer service, half my salary, would go to my rent and tenant usually require you to earn 3x the rent price.

Right now I am doing a law degree in my third year and absolutely hate it. I don't want to work in the law field but chose it by default since Fribourg University, where I live, has a good reputation for law but not for business nor finance. No bank would have hired me with a degree from here. I feel lost and broken and angry.

1jzptji,sour_chili,"Insured with Swisscare as a student ‚Äì now being asked to pay CHF 20,000 to Helsana","Hello everyone

My girlfriend studied in Switzerland from 2019 to 2024 and was covered by Swisscare during that time ‚Äì a digital insurance provider based in Switzerland ‚Äì as a student. After finishing her studies, she switched to Helsana and has now been insured with them for the past 6 months.

Recently, Helsana contacted her and is now requesting an official confirmation that she was exempt from the compulsory Swiss health insurance (KVG) during her studies from 2019 to 2024. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was not aware that such a document existed, and neither Swisscare nor anyone else informed her about this requirement. Supposedly, you need to request this document upon arrival in Switzerland. 

Swisscare has not been helpful in this matter and refers us to the health insurance authority. However, the KVG office informed us that they do not issue retroactive exemption documents and advised us to clarify the issue with Helsana. According to KVG, it should be sufficient to provide proof of valid health insurance during her studies.

Hence, we also spoke to Helsana on the phone, and they confirmed that submitting the insurance certificates from Swisscare via the Helsana portal should be enough. Based on that, we uploaded all relevant documents.

Today, however, we received a message from Helsana stating that they will not accept the proof after all, and are now demanding that we pay retroactive premiums for the entire 4-year period (CHF 400 per month \* 12 months \* 4 years). We are talking about a total amount of around CHF 20,000, which we find outrageous considering the fact that my girlfriend was insured the whole time.

Has anyone had a similar experience or does anyone know a possible solution to this issue?

1m64rve,pricendalis123,Working as dentist from foreign country,"Hello /askswitzerland!

QUESTION/-s

1) Do you feel like there is a shortage of dentists in Switzerland? Does it take like 1-2 months to get appointment when you try to schedule it? I understand it will depend on city you live in but in general this could help me understand the overall picture

2) Are Swiss people welcoming for foreigner to start working in such position? Both employer wise and would you as patient feel comfortable if person working on your teeth isn't Swiss?

3) Maybe you know someone in your life who is a dentist is Switzerland? I tried reaching out to some clinics in Zug and Bern but got 0 responses. Would be great to make some contacts in this field abroad. I was thinking maybe there are some connections between my uni and uni in Bern or Zug but there are non, so I'm on my own.

  
I'd appreciate if you have any other comments in this matter, maybe something I didn't mention or something that is important before I start thinking about this more seriously.

BACKGROUND

I'm a dental student, currently studying in the 3rd year (out of 5) in Lithuania.

For the last year or so I've heard multiple colleagues talk about moving abroad to work- everyone has their own reasoning is it for bigger salary, experience or they simply like the country they'd love to move to.

I've been thinking of possibly moving to Switzerland when I graduate. This means I'd have a diploma in the field of Dentistry that legally allows me to work as dentist in Switzerland.

At the same time I've been reading other subreddits about work situation in Switzerland and it seems like people have trouble finding jobs- I guess it's the same where I'm from but again- everyone's situation is different so it's hard to tell.  

Also the reason why I decided to make this post is that recently there appeared a chance for me to study German for basically the rest of my study period at my uni.

Reasoning for me thinking about working as dentist in Switzerland is: 1) Swiss dentistry is on a very high level and it'd be great experience for me as a dentist 2)from what I understand Swiss people love privacy- it's something I respect and value as well 3)nature- i love hiking, nature, I'm very active sports wise. I lived in some other mountain countries for \~year before and I really enjoyed the aspect of that

The gross PhD salary is likely to be between CHF 47,000 and CHF 55,000 per year. I‚Äôve read that the net monthly salary could be around CHF 3,500. In your experience, is this sufficient for a couple to live comfortably in Lugano, considering all expenses (rent, food, health insurance, etc.)?
Is it possible to apply for a spouse visa at the same time as the student visa for the PhD candidate? If so, could you please share any important requirements or tips in the comments?
Note: I am non-European and currently living alone in Rome, having just completed my Master‚Äôs degree.

Thanks in advance for your help!",True,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,

1gsebwc,Buttercookie456,Is Lugano a student friendly city?,"Hello! Last week, I got accepted into the MSc in Media Management at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) in Lugano for the February intake. I like this course; it's a 2-year programme, very comprehensive, includes an internship and there seems to be a lot to learn.

1f331ev,SwissLover2004,Bachelor in CS at ETH or EPFL?,"I want to study a CS undergraduate degree in ETH or EPFL and I have no idea which one to choose. Because of the following reasons.

‚Ä¢Reputation: They're both ranked among the best university worldwide being ETH 9 and EPFL 11 in CS (QS Ranking by subject CS 2024) and globally being ETH 7 and EPFL 26. I want to work in Switzerland so I think both are pretty much at the same level.

‚Ä¢Exchange programmes: ETH has much more top tier options such as MIT, Princeton, NUS, NUT...

‚Ä¢Internships: In ETH are hard to get because exams are in summer, but I don't actually think that that will be really relevant because I already have experience in IT industry and because internship at EFPL will be like 2 months long so there no much time to actually take profit of it.

‚Ä¢City; I've been in Zurich a couple times and I love it it's where I want to live in the long run, but at the same time because of that I might want to live in other places before settling down also I've heard that Lausanne has a better student life vibe.

‚Ä¢Master: I've heard that studying at EPFL guarantees you access to masters in EPFL and ETH does not.

‚Ä¢Toughness: I've seen that both of them are pretty much equally challenging being ETH less intense but without vacations and EPFL very intense during semester but with real holidays.

This is pretty much the information I've got of both unis.

Je cherche une formation accessible en ligne, avec des professeurs compr√©hensifs car je dois √† travailler en parall√®le, en attendant de valider le Master et de trouver un stage pour m'ouvrir les portes vers le monde professionnel.
3. **Les d√©bouch√©s**¬†: Quels types de m√©tiers sont accessibles dans ce domaine, que je peux exercer sois en Suisse ou USA (je veux travailler √† l'internationale car j'aime beaucoup voyager et d√©couvrir le monde).
4. **Les salaires** pour un d√©butant en Suisse.
5. **Les m√©tiers demand√©s et la diff√©rence entre chacun** : European Affairs Officer in International Relations Division, Analyste en strat√©gie ou relations internationales (en d√©fense, diplomatie, consulting), Consultant en management ou en intelligence √©conomique (secteurs de l‚Äôa√©ronautique, finance, ou d√©fense).

In particolare vorrei fare un master che riguarda la finanza/informatica (sto facendo ing. informatica al momento e sono al secondo anno). Volevo fare qualche domanda ai ticinesi, che possono rispondermi con pi√π cognizione di causa. 

1. Io vorrei lavorare nel segmento IT di qualche banca/fondo/assicurazione o comunque vorrei sviluppare software per questi enti, siete a conoscenza di opportunit√† di lavoro vicino Lugano in questo campo? √® ragionevole pensare di trovare lavoro in zona? 
2. Vorrei vivere in Svizzera e non fare il frontaliere, perch√® lo reputo un comportamento molto scorretto ed in seguito vorrei prendere anche la cittadinanza (ho letto che ci vogliono una decina d'anni, ma non credo sia un problema), √® possibile permettersi una casa a prezzi umani o ci sono prezzi assurdi come in Lombardia? (Anche in periferia va bene)
3. C'√® una qualche borsa di studio che mi agevolerebbe all'inizio? Il master costa 16k franchi ed io non sono esattamente ricco. Inoltre l'universit√† permette di lavorare soltanto 15 ore a settimana mentre si frequenta, quindi non avrei molta libert√† di fare universit√†-lavoro come faccio adesso.
4. In generale com'√® trovare lavoro, soprattutto nel settore dell'educazione? La mia ragazza √® laureata in scienze della formazione e ovviamente mi seguirebbe. 
5. Come sono visti gli italiani? So che gli italiani non sono molto ben visti per il fatto che causano l'abbassamento dei salari e vivono in italia, ottenendo solo vantaggi e non soffrendo delle conseguenze. Ma come ho detto io vorrei vivere l√¨ insieme alla mia ragazza e nel complesso mi sento pi√π affine alla cultura svizzera che non a quella italiana (sono molto serio per quanto riguarda il lavoro, ad esempio), questo mio comportamento sarebbe visto meglio?

I am planning to start a MSc at Basel University in September. I am a EU citizen and have been living in Switzerland (although in a different canton) for over 2 years already, the last year and a half on a B permit.

- I am struggling to find clear information on the permits regulations in my case (should I apply for a new permit, or can I keep my current permit and therefore start working immediately? Do I have the 15 hrs/week restriction anyway as a EU citizen with B permit? If anyone with the same experience could share their knowledge that would be extremely useful). 

- to the main question: once I finally start working, considering I can only work part-time I accounted for a netto salary of about 1200.-/1400.- . Is that realistic? (I would try for research assistant in some Molecular biology lab and if not that would go back to hospitality. I know some basic German and fluent in French and Italian, with fine dining experience).

If the number is right, students in Basel with the same situation, can you survive with that? I am excluding the rent cost as I will move in with my partner and won‚Äôt have to pay the rent. 
I have quite a bit of savings to fall back on but I really would hate to deplete my savings so quickly if the part time job isn‚Äôt enough, as I worked hard and long to save it. 

- bonus question: has anyone ever been able to get some funding for the master thesis research project ? I will do the Molecular Biology MSc . If possible that would be a game changer.

I write nice letters to introduce myself with the help of my Swiss friends so the letter is in Swiss german. I am a 23-year old male, I am from Hungary, I have a B permit as I am doing a MSc here. I currently live in student accommodation which is quite crappy and I would really like to move into a studio/1-room (tired of flatmates). I would be able to afford it now as I recently started an internship that pays pretty well, so my income is always at least 3x the rent. I will likely stay in Basel after my MSc for a PhD, so I am looking to rent long term, which I also make sure to indicate. Recently I even started trying to outbid the listed price (e.g., the ad will say the rent is 950 and I will say in my letter that I would be willing to go up to 1100 CHF). Still nothing. 

Can anybody local or somebody who's been through this point out what might be wrong? This whole thing is wearing me thin :( Thank you in advance.",True,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,

3. For all digital documents I upload, do I need to upload a certified true copy or I only need to upload a scanned file of my original copy?

1jek53d,Bright_Roll8454,Zurich nightlife/dating life,"
Hello everyone!

I (23 F) just received an offer for a Master‚Äôs in Biomedical Engineering at ETH Zurich, and I‚Äôve started wondering what my life would look like if I moved to Switzerland for the next two years.

I know ETH has an excellent academic reputation, so I‚Äôm confident in the quality of my studies. However, I also value my overall happiness, social life, and state of mind just as much. I‚Äôm an outgoing person who loves to socialize, and I need an environment where I can enjoy life outside of academics.

For context, I‚Äôm from Romania, where nightlife is pretty lively‚Äîwe stay out until 5-6 AM on weekends, people are warm and easy to talk to, and dating life is quite enjoyable. When it comes to relationships, there‚Äôs more of a traditional mindset, and men generally embrace chivalry, like paying for dates, bringing flowers, and taking on a more provider-oriented role.

So, I‚Äôd love to hear from those of you living in Zurich:

	‚Ä¢	How is the social scene? Is there nightlife, or is it really dead after 6 PM?
	‚Ä¢	How easy is it to make friends as an expat? Are people truly cold and distant?
	‚Ä¢	What is the dating scene like? Is it more modern and independent, or do traditional values still exist?
	‚Ä¢	Are weekends, especially Sundays, really that quiet?

I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions‚Äîsome people say Zurich is boring, expensive, and lifeless, while others say it‚Äôs great if you know where to look. I‚Äôd love to hear honest opinions from people who have experienced it!

My alternative option would be studying in the Netherlands‚Äîso if you also have insights on how the social life compares between the two, I‚Äôd appreciate it!

Thanks in advance! üòä

1hxohw3,hermitismus,Accommodations for mental illness ,"Hello, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place, but I really need some input.

I‚Äôm chronically mentally ill and currently attending an Erwachsenen Gymnasium, I'm 23 and it's my last year.  
For the most part, I‚Äôve been managing okay, It‚Äôs been tough being surrounded by so many people and sticking to early wake-ups since I‚Äôm more of a loner when it comes to studying, but I‚Äôve pushed through and felt fine, mostly.

These past months, though, have been really rough.   
My mental health has tanked, and I‚Äôve fallen behind. I‚Äôve already missed one exam for a subject a few months prior, and I have my second one for it tomorrow. But my brain won't let me focus. I haven't slept at all in the past two days and lost a lot of weight. I usually push through it but right now, I can't.  
  
My problem is, I‚Äôm terrified that if I miss another exam, they‚Äôll make me take a gap year.  
I‚Äôm so close to the end of the semester and having to stay home for an entire year would worsen my situation quite a lot.

So I just wanted to ask if they could force me to take a gap year. Are there any laws or policies in Switzerland or Zurich specifically that require schools to provide accommodations or support for students going through a mental health crisis? Or can they just say, ""nope, bye""?  
I have talked to my therapist a few days ago and he is writing me a ""Therapiebest√§tigung"" with current diagnosis, etc, but I'm still really anxious about it. I have not made the best experience with this particular school sadly.

Quick visa question for international students I‚Äôm hoping someone can guide me through: I‚Äôm coming from the US to start my masters at UZH in the fall. Before I enter Switzerland for my studies, am I understanding correctly that I need to enter CH with a student visa? If so, under the list of required documents, it mentions proof of payment of tuition/registration, but in order for me to matriculate i would need a physical address in CH to be on file with the university so documents etc can be mailed and the like. The kicker is how would I be able to register for classes by June in order to allow enough processing time for my visa so I can be able to start my studies in September when I won‚Äôt be in the country at that time to finalize accommodation needed for registration and the visa process? Also, is it even possible to matriculate that early for the fall semester?

If anyone has experience with this or any loopholes/tips on how to navigate around this, that would be greatly appreciated.

so a few months ago, the people who live upstairs from me, had a problem with their washroom, basically they were dumb enough to unscrew their shower drain and the cap of their shampoo bottle got stuck in the drain.

now, i asked them for several months to reimburse me, they kept delaying and then finally the woman who lives above me, texted me that,

""the stuff that was damaged is not considered 'valuables' by their liability insurance company, therefore they will not pay any money to me. I should contact my OWN insurance to get reimbursed for this""

as you can obviously see, they screwed up and are asking me to talk to MY insurance to reimburse. which sounds like a poor attempt from them at shifting blame/responsibility

* i don't have liability insurance

1ii6nf7,WonderfulHost7630,Looking for like-minded people to connect with,"Hey all, hope you‚Äôre doing good. I thought twice about posting this, but I decided to give it a shot.

I‚Äôm a student in the third cycle, studying theoretical physics and chemistry. I‚Äôm the type who gets inspired by others quickly and likes to inspire as well, you could call it a two-way highway. I enjoy being around people who are active, curious, and eager to learn ""*useful""* things, with no boundaries when it comes to learning (as long as there‚Äôs respect, of course). I like sports and living a healthy lifestyle; not a must, but to me, it shows self-awareness and the discipline to stay fit and maintain that for the long run. Being nerdy isn‚Äôt necessary, but if you are, that‚Äôs cool too.

I‚Äôm half introvert, I like to release my energy as soon as I feel my batteries are full. I respect others, I‚Äôm honest, and I like to help whenever I can. Words like inspiration, enthusiasm, passion, setting goals, and learning from others really resonate with me.

Last but not least, I value positivity and enjoy being around positive energy, even if the world feels like it‚Äôs on the edge of a seventh world war. Too much negativity and a lack of optimism are red flags for me. I still respect people who carry those views, but I know what I want from life, I have goals to achieve, things to discover, and dreams to pursue.

If you feel like we‚Äôd vibe, let‚Äôs hang out and maybe become friends. I‚Äôm based in Bern, and I don‚Äôt mind traveling around once a week or so, Switzerland isn‚Äôt that big. I‚Äôm male, in my early thirties.

**Note:** If you‚Äôre just suggesting local clubs or leaving polite comments, I appreciate it, but no need, I‚Äôm already part of a local football club and play in the workers‚Äô league under the Swiss Football Federation.

\-Currently work in a bike shop part time/50%/20 hours per week (I recently finished my degree, still waiting for the paperwork)

\-minor experience in IT (we did some programming in physics)

Ideally I would like a job in the physics/natural sciences/IT sector and going back to bike mechanic would be the least desirable option.

1dpne1f,Japap_,CAF - Que faire pour enfin l'obtenir ?,"Hey Redditor, I have been studying in France for 3 years and I'm about to move out, but I still have not received any information about the status of my CAF housing pension. I have applied (for sure, I'm 110% sure of that as I did it with my other friends) at the beginning of the first year. Hence my question- I am going to study in Switzerland for my masters degree and I would love to receive my CAF founds - what should I do in order to do so? can they be cancelled? would changing my residence to Paris provide any benefits? I have not received any emails nor letters from them. Thank you in advance!

 **Deux ans apr√®s avoir choqu√© Bruxelles en d√©cidant brutalement de mettre fin √† de longues ann√©es de n√©gociations, le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, a annonc√© qu'un mandat de n√©gociation avec l'UE serait pr√™t ¬´¬†avant la fin de l'ann√©e¬†¬ª. Comment expliquer cette volont√© de Berne de vouloir renouer les liens avec l'Union europ√©enne ? Ce rapprochement intervient au moment o√π le pr√©sident fran√ßais Emmanuel Macron doit se rendre en Suisse les 15 et 16 novembre prochain.** **Analyse.** 

[ Image du pr√©sident Alain Berset de la Conf√©d√©ration suisse le 19 octobre 2018 √† Bruxelles  ](https://preview.redd.it/5wckisr6phzb1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d7c7487f9c326e589d32e9611f71371dbb712e)

Est-ce le d√©but de la fin d'une longue crise entre l'Union europ√©enne et la Suisse ? En 2021, la Suisse avait mis fin aux n√©gociations de l'accord-cadre avec Bruxelles. Cet accord devait r√©gir les relations entre la Conf√©d√©ration et l'Union sur des domaines aussi larges que la recherche scientifique, la question des travailleurs d√©tach√©s ou la r√©glementation financi√®re ou la question plus sensible de la libre circulation des personnes.

L'√©conomie suisse est tr√®s int√©gr√©e au march√© unique. Il faut reprendre le chemin de la n√©gociation.

**Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.**

Faute d'accord entre les diff√©rentes formations politiques en Suisse m√™me, Berne avait quitt√© la table des n√©gociations. Deux ans plus tard, l'heure est de nouveau au dialogue. Des n√©gociations technique entre Berne et Bruxelles selon la RTS (Radio t√©l√©vision suisse) ont repris au plus haut niveau d√®s avril 2022. Ces premi√®res discussions portaient sur de nouveaux accords dans le domaine de l'√©lectricit√©, de la r√©glementation financi√®re ou du programme europ√©en de recherche Horizon.

## √âchec des n√©gociations en 2021

Selon Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve et sp√©cialiste des relations entre l'Union europ√©enne et la Suisse, Berne n'avait pas le choix. *""L'√©conomie suisse est tr√®s int√©gr√©e au march√© unique, bien plus d'autres pays qui ne sont pas dans l'Union europ√©enne comme le Royaume-Uni. Il faut reprendre le chemin de la n√©gociation"",* explique Ren√© Schwok. Plus de 69% des importations de la Suisse viennent des pays membres de l'Union europ√©enne. Et 50% des exportations suisses sont √† destination de l'Union europ√©enne selon la Mission de la Suisse aupr√®s de l'UE.

[**Lire : Suisse, un mandat de n√©gociations avec l'UE pr√™t ""avant la fin de l'ann√©e""**](https://information.tv5monde.com/international/suisse-un-mandat-de-negociations-avec-lue-pret-avant-la-fin-de-lannee-2674847)

L'Union europ√©enne en 2021 a pris des mesures contre la Suisse suite √† l'√©chec des n√©gociations sur l'accord- cadre.

*""Deux d'entres elles ont un impact sur l'√©conomie suisse. Le projet Horizon est un programme de d√©veloppement de la recherche universitaire et scientifique en Europe. Les universit√©s suisses et les centres de recherche suisses sont exclus de ce programme. Ce n'est pas le cas de pays comme l'Albanie ou le Royaume-Uni qui ne font pas partie de l'Union europ√©enne. C'est un vrai probl√®me car cela peut entrainer une fuite des cerveaux du pays. Et une perte de comp√©titivit√© pour le pays""*, explique Ren√© Schwok.

L'Union europ√©enne a mis en place une autre mesure en r√©ponse √† la fin des n√©gociations de 2021.¬† Elle concerne les *""obstacles techniques au commerce"".*

Ce sont des normes qui r√©gissent l‚Äôexportation ou l'importation de produits. La Suisse avait mis en place des accords pour √©viter ces obstacles techniques au commerce. En clair, il s'agissait de permettre aux produits suisses d'√™tre export√©s facilement sans faire face √† des probl√®mes de normes propres au march√© europ√©en. L'Union europ√©enne remet aujourd'hui en cause cette facilit√©.

*""Les contr√¥les techniques sur les produits suisses ont √©t√© r√©tablis. La Suisse exporte beaucoup de machine-outil et, de m√©dicaments via son industrie pharmaceutique. Le secteur suisse du mat√©riel m√©dical d√©pend √©galement du march√© europ√©en. Cette mesure p√©nalise l'√©conomie suisse et ses exportations vers le march√© unique"",* d√©crit  Ren√© Schwok, sp√©cialiste des relations entre la Suisse et l'Union europ√©enne.

## Recherche du consensus

Le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, est favorable √† une reprise des n√©gociations avec l'Union europ√©enne. Mais trouvera-t-il un consensus politique dans ce sens ?

En 2021, Berne avait d√©cid√© de mettre fin au projet d'accord cadre √† cause des dissension internes en Suisse. *""Les n√©gociations buttent souvent sur des questions internes. Lorsque le gouvernement est confront√© √† une trop forte opposition il abandonne le projet. Il y a en Suisse une culture du consensus politique"",* explique Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

*Les relations entre la France et la Suisse se sont fortement refroidies lorsque la Conf√©d√©ration, au m√©pris de toute consid√©ration strat√©gique, a d√©cid√© d'acheter des avions de combat am√©ricain, les F35, au d√©triment d'un avion europ√©en, le Rafale fran√ßais.*

**Pascal Sciarini , professeur de Sciences politques √† l'Universit√© de Geneve.**

*""Les n√©gociations se jouent donc √† deux niveaux. D'abord avec l'Union europ√©enne, et¬†ensuite il faut n√©gocier √† l‚Äôint√©rieur du pays avec les formations politiques ou avec les syndicats. La gauche essaie de marchander son soutien. Les syndicats √©galement. L'UDC (*droite conservatrice hostile √† l'Union europ√©enne*) dit non par principe. Le Conseil f√©d√©ral n'a pas la m√™me marge de man≈ìuvre que le pr√©sident fran√ßais"",* d√©crit Ren√© Schwok.

Pascal Sciarini, professeur de Sciences politiques √† l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Gen√®ve abonde dans le m√™me sens. *""En Suisse on cherche √† construire des coalitions larges. On ne raisonne pas en terme de camp politique contre un autre. Les n√©gociations pourraient reprendre parce qu'une coalition a pu se construire et a pu isoler l'UDC sur cette question europ√©enne"",* confirme le professeur en Sciences politiques.

Le pr√©sident Emmanuel Macron doit se rendre ce 15 novembre en Suisse et rencontrer Alain Berset, le Pr√©sident de la Conf√©d√©ration suisse. Selon Marc Ferraci d√©put√© de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle et proche d'Emmanuel Macron, dans un entretien donn√© √† la Tribune de Gen√®ve le 6 novembre dernier cette visite doit servir √† *""r√©affirmer la profondeur des liens""* entre la Suisse et la France.

## Une √©conomie int√©gr√©e √† l'Union europ√©enne

*""Les relations entre la France et la Suisse se sont fortement refroidies lorsque la Conf√©d√©ration au m√©pris de toute consid√©ration strat√©gique a d√©cid√© d'acheter des avions de combat am√©ricains, les F35, au d√©triment d'un avion europ√©en, le Rafale fran√ßais. Cet √©pisode a fortement irrit√© les Fran√ßais"",* explique Pascal Sciarini , professeur de Sciences politiques √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

*""Le Conseil f√©d√©ral aujourd‚Äôhui veut renouer les liens avec l'Union europ√©enne et dans ce cadre-l√† le gouvernement suisse veut avoir de bonnes relations inter-√©tatiques avec des pays membres de l'Union europ√©enne. La France est un pays membre de l'Union europ√©enne. M√™me si de fait c'est la Commission qui d√©cidera de l‚Äôissue des n√©gociations, on cherche avoir un canal de n√©gociations inter √©tatiques"",* ajoute Pascal Sciarini, professeur de sciences politiques √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

Le processus de n√©gociation ne fait que commencer. En marge de ses discussions avec l'Union europ√©enne, le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, a entam√© des discussions avec les syndicats. Ces derniers d√©noncent une lib√©ralisation du mod√®le suisse sur la protection des salaires.

n5mhonp,azarano,,"There's a list of foreign universities that accept/eligible for FAFSA funding, and University College London is on the list: https://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/international-schools-in-federal-loan-programs.pdf. just not sure of the date of that list, so you should confirm you can list the school(s) you're interested in on your FAFSA if financial aid is necessary for your studies.

Just like in the States, you'll need to apply as a full-time degree-seeking student to these universities, not as a semester or year exchange student or study abroad student. So it'd be better for you to research a university's admissions process as an international student first, with special attention to the deadlines and timeframe for their study permit/student visa process. European universities don't often offer general education courses, and don't use the term 'major', but have you start right on your degree topic courses right away. So you'll need to decide on a topic of study too if wanting to do your whole degree abroad.

The challenges you're finding (school works differently, application time frames are different, financial requirements for the visa) are familiar ones for any student wanting to study in a different country, whether it's a whole degree or a semester abroad. I'd suggest to narrow down which topics you'd like to study, which country or two you'd like to study in besides the US, and then do a lot more specific research on what's required to apply to those schools, and what kind of aid may be possible. Right now you're at the start of this research.

Also: it will be simpler to attend a US university with strong study abroad connections, and do a semester or year away as an exchange or study abroad student... Or do multiple away programs! That way you're not committed to a place for years, and both schools provide resources to help students adjust to a new place, choose courses (classes) and apply for a student visa if necessary. That's why it's so much more common for US students to do it this way instead of a whole degree abroad, though it is definitely possible.

I don't think some random university in Europe will really differ in education from any Chinese uni and master programs are also almost always cash cows and not necessarily more rigourous than what you'll find in your own country. 

I am honestly quite curious why you would not try to find a job in China which these days pay at European level in all the major cities and spend savings of parents, and move to a different country when the West is becoming wary of China. You will also love away from family and friends.",True,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,1ki9a74

mupmgl2,Intrepid-Pick6715,,"Honest answer from a Grad from Germany with MS in CS. DS degrees have lost in today's tech market to be fair. Every tom dick and harry is providing the tutorials online. 

I'll tell you what this degree can give you - an access to the European market but only after having a PR with permission to work out of Switzerland. 

The EU Economy is fucked up until they wake up to the reality. You can go for it if you are ready to face the utterly depressing reality of these countries - Loneliness, homesickness, constant urge to save and make money, relaxed education systems ( You came for 2 years of MS and suddenly it's 4 years now and you are struggling to find a job) also nor to mention the willingness to study after part time jobs or after a gap of 4 years you had.

DS degrees have lost in today's tech market to be fair. Every tom dick and harry is providing the tutorials online. 

I'll tell you what this degree can give you - an access to the European market but only after having a PR with permission to work out of Switzerland. 

The EU Economy is fucked up until they wake up to the reality. You can go for it if you are ready to face the utterly depressing reality of these countries - Loneliness, homesickness, constant urge to save and make money, relaxed education systems ( You came for 2 years of MS and suddenly it's 4 years now and you are struggling to find a job) also nor to mention the willingness to study after part time jobs or after a gap of 4 years you had.

The city is home to major finance Firms, Healthcare Giants, Startups, and Even International Organizations. A Data Science Degree from UZH gives you credibility, and your 4 years of IT experience give you a real edge over fresh grads. That said, companies here do prefer EU/Swiss applicants due to easier hiring rules. But it‚Äôs not impossible. Many non-EU grads land jobs; it just takes persistence, good networking, and ideally some German skills (even B1 helps). After graduation, you can apply for a 6-month permit to search for a job. If you find one, your employer can sponsor your work permit, as long as they prove they couldn‚Äôt find a local/EU candidate. So yes, it‚Äôs competitive, but doable with the right strategy.

for the moment is I‚Äôm currently finishing up my first year of BTech in Computer Science , but there‚Äôs a potential shift happening. My parent works at Nestl√© and will likely be posted in Vevey, Switzerland for the next 2‚Äì3 years.

Since they‚Äôll be there, I‚Äôm seriously considering transferring or restarting my bachelor‚Äôs in Switzerland. However, I don‚Äôt speak any German or French (yet), and I‚Äôm wondering:
	‚Ä¢	Are there any English-taught bachelor‚Äôs programs in Switzerland, especially in engineering or related fields?
	‚Ä¢	If I get accepted, how feasible is it to learn German/French while studying?
	‚Ä¢	Any recommendations on universities that might be a good fit?
	‚Ä¢	Would it be worth transferring credits from my current program or starting fresh?

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated! Especially from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation or studied in Switzerland or Germany without initially knowing the local languages.

Thanks in advance!

I‚Äôm an international student from India, studying Computer Science at the University of Basel. I came to Switzerland in September 2024 with big dreams and a lot of hope ‚Äî but I‚Äôm now facing an extremely difficult situation emotionally, academically, and legally.

I come from a very poor background. My parents are separated, and I have no relatives, no support system, and no one to rely on here. My mother is a daily wage laborer back home, and I took an education loan with the goal of building a better life for my family. But everything has been going wrong.

I‚Äôve **failed two semesters** and have only managed to earn **12 credits** so far. The Swiss education system is very different from India, and I‚Äôve struggled a lot with oral exams, presentations, and understanding lectures. On top of that, I‚Äôve had **no part-time job** and constant mental stress. I‚Äôm trying hard, but I feel overwhelmed and alone.

Now, I am **really worried about my life**. I don‚Äôt know **how the student permit works** ‚Äî if I fail again, **will I be asked to leave Switzerland?**  
If I have to go back to India now, **everything will collapse** ‚Äî my loan, my future, my mother‚Äôs sacrifices. I am **not trying to break any laws**, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to stay here **legally** and rebuild myself.

I attended the ""Master's Open Days"" event in person in March of this year and the information I got from almost everyone is the following: acceptance letters/ conditional offers are sent out on a rolling basis, because in the middle/end of every month (depending on faculty and program) the admission committee for the program (different for every program and independent from the university admissions committee/office) holds a meeting to accept students who have sent their application by the end of the previous month.

mpvj3fj,justyannicc,,"First of all, student loans are a demand subsidy. If you want to study at HSG, you need to understand this basic economic concept. Subsidizing demand just increases the price for the same amount of supply as it did in the United States. It didn't actually do anything besides just increase the prices. Student loans were a great idea for the first few years and then prices just kept rising because there is no limit on how much they could take out, which was guaranteed by the federal government, and even if there was a limit then that it would just increase the price by that amount. It's a demand-side subsidy. It's not a supply-side increase, therefore decreasing the price. This is basic economics.

Second of all, yes, this does actually exist in Switzerland, to a lesser degree, but it does exist. Scholarships and student loans both exist in Switzerland, just not to the same degree, because it's usually not necessary. And if you do not qualify for a state scholarship, which you should if your parents can't afford it, then there are plenty of other options. Even with a scholarship from the government, you're expected to live with your parents during that time unless there is a reason you can't like really deep running family feud.

Third, Why do you think our universities cost basically nothing? We pay about a 1,500.- CHF per year to attend university here. That is nothing. And do you know why? Because we don't have all the extra shit that every other place in the US does. It's not a good idea to add that stuff and just pay more.

Fourth, pretty much all of our universities are top-tier. You do not want a two-class system. It is a good idea to have all universities have a very high standard, which is good across the board. Not just a few top universities and then a few medium ones. ETH is one of the best schools in the world. So is University of Zurich. So I do not know what you're complaining here about. Any school in Switzerland will provide you with a decent education, and if you're expecting to go to a top university, you're just doing it because of the status, and quite frankly, a dick-measuring contest.

Fifth, Yes. Why should you work hard in high school? Be a goddamn teenager. It's enough to just pass. Why should you put in any more effort? You know what they call the worst guy that graduates from med school? Doctor.

Sixth, The system very much does incentivize excellence, just not when you're in high school, because it's not necessary. When you're doing a PhD or a master's, yes, very much so, and it will help being excellent there, but anything before that, why would you care? It's just useless, wasted time, where you could be living life.

If you're doing a degree that you do not like, that is your own fault. You could have gone to the school you wanted to without any issue. I sucked in high school. And I had to retake all my exams on my own dime years later while I was working, a hundred percent, and I passed. I did it over the course of one and a half years, and I passed, and I'm studying at university because of that. During the time that I worked 100%, I was able to establish myself within a company. I started in a low-level role, but became important within the company and can now work part-time during university and can support myself if I wanted too. The budget for a student is clearly outlined on their websites, it's a little more than two grand a month, which isn't that much. You can easily find a WG and reduce your costs. I'm not saying it doesn't suck, it does, but you can.

I'd like to mention here, before I started the current company I am at, I worked for [eat.ch](http://eat.ch) as a delivery driver, and I made, for 10 hours a week, a little over a grand. So this is very much possible. And again, if the calculator on the Canton's website says your parents do not have to pay, the Canton will give you the money. It's one or the other. And if the canton doesn't give you a scholarship, they will give you a loan.

Edit: I'd like to clarify here. I'm not saying this system doesn't need reform. It absolutely does. There's a lot of things that need to change, such as the Bundesrat wanting to save money at the cost of students doubling their tuition. That's a bad idea. But Switzerland already does a lot of things well. Quite frankly, there are already a lot of systems in place to help you, and if you cannot find them on your own, you shouldn't go to university. Yes, there's a lot of things that could be done better and more money allocated for this kind of thing. You don't have to make large sacrifices to go to university, in my opinion. I would rather eat less meat for a few years than be stuck with student loans until I'm 65.

Edit 2:  
Something I forgot to mention but is very important is the lack of student housing forces students to integrate into normal society. With student housing in the US, you're separated on a campus, separate from the rest of society, which means the experiences of a student are very different from a regular citizen. Here, you're just another citizen going to the university. You take the same train as a person going to work, so you're gonna have the same complaint if the train is late, for example. This is a good thing. You want people to share the same reality. Otherwise, you create a two tiered society.",Switzerland,swiss student visa,10,https://reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1kblccg/the_swiss_university_system_compared_to_other/mpvj3fj/,1746034573.0,comment,en,0.9764617085456848,"First of all, student loans are a demand subsidy.

I'd like to mention here, before I started the current company I am at, I worked for [eat.ch](http://eat.ch) as a delivery driver, and I made, for 10 hours a week, a little over a grand. So this is very much possible. And again, if the calculator on the Canton's website says your parents do not have to pay, the Canton will give you the money. It's one or the other. And if the canton doesn't give you a scholarship, they will give you a loan.

Edit: I'd like to clarify here. I'm not saying this system doesn't need reform. It absolutely does. There's a lot of things that need to change, such as the Bundesrat wanting to save money at the cost of students doubling their tuition. That's a bad idea. But Switzerland already does a lot of things well. Quite frankly, there are already a lot of systems in place to help you, and if you cannot find them on your own, you shouldn't go to university. Yes, there's a lot of things that could be done better and more money allocated for this kind of thing. You don't have to make large sacrifices to go to university, in my opinion. I would rather eat less meat for a few years than be stuck with student loans until I'm 65.

Edit 2:  
Something I forgot to mention but is very important is the lack of student housing forces students to integrate into normal society. With student housing in the US, you're separated on a campus, separate from the rest of society, which means the experiences of a student are very different from a regular citizen. Here, you're just another citizen going to the university. You take the same train as a person going to work, so you're gonna have the same complaint if the train is late, for example. This is a good thing. You want people to share the same reality. Otherwise, you create a two tiered society.",True,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,1kblccg

mnsslmw,Accurate_Scar_6653,,"Hi, I work for a Swiss compulsory health insurance company so maybe I can help with some parts. 

First, when your GF arrived in Switzerland and went to get registered for her permit, the canton was obligated to make sure she had a compulsory insurance. So she probably had to submit her certificate to the KVG. Otherwise, they would have affiliated her themselves to an insurer of their choice. 

Second, Helsana has no right to request 4+ years of retroactive premiums. The law is clear on this matter (art. 5 KVG) : a client must sign its KVG contract during the 3 first months upon arrival in the country. If done during that time, the insurance starts at the date of entry in Switzerland (date on the B permit or residence certificate). If the contract was signed after the 3 months, the contract will start at the date of signature. Which means you will pay the premiums from that date. 

However Helsana can apply a penalty fee: 30% to 50% of the premium and the duration depends on how late she was:  they will calculate how many days there is between her date of arrival in Switzerland and the date of signature with Helsana and will double it. This penalty is added to the normal premium. 

Where I work, when someone signs a contract with us and let‚Äôs us know that they were previously insured by Swisscare, we do ask for the exemption. This is because Swisscare is not considered as compulsory health insurance and it is not our role to verify that your insurance covers at the same standards as KVG. If the client cannot provide this document, we will start the insurance at the date of signature and apply the penalty fee. 

If your GF has a legal insurance, I highly recommend she contacts them to help her with this matter. 

The KVG didn‚Äôt do its job if they never asked for proof of insurance when she arrived in Switzerland or give her exemption when she presented the Swisscare certificate. 

Helsana has no right to requested premiums for the time before her date of signature with them, unless it was a request from the KVG office as an automatic affiliation. 

My office also offers an insurance for students like Swisscare and we always provide the form that the client must fill out for exemption and we have to sign it as well to confirm it is equivalent to the KVg.

mtfva7t,sour_chili,,"Zuerst einmal danke f√ºr die Antwort. 

Ich wollte eigentlich schon fr√ºher ein Update zum Fall geben, bin aber bisher nicht dazu gekommen, da die Abkl√§rungen weiterhin andauern und nebenbei noch einiges l√§uft.

Hier eine kurze Zusammenfassung des bisherigen Verlaufs:

* Meine Freundin ist Anfang September 2019 in die Schweiz eingereist.
* Am 24. September wurde ihr vom Kanton Basel-Stadt ein Informationsschreiben zur KVG-Pflicht zugestellt. Das Schreiben konnte jedoch nicht zugestellt werden und wurde als unzustellbar retourniert (entsprechender Nachweis liegt vor).
* Am 5. November 2019 meldete der Kanton Basel-Stadt meine Freundin der Gemeinsamen Einrichtung KVG als unversichert (Info von Kanton Basel-Stadt so erhalten).
* Die Information ist entweder bei der Gemeinsamen Einrichtung KVG nicht eingetroffen oder wurde nicht korrekt verarbeitet. Ich habe nachtr√§glich nochmals um eine Pr√ºfung des Falls gebeten bzw. eine nachtr√§gliche Freistellung der KVG-Pflicht beantragt. Die Abkl√§rungen sind noch in Gange. 

Nach unserem Verst√§ndnis h√§tte in der Folge eine Zwangszuweisung zu einer Schweizer Krankenversicherung durch die Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG erfolgen m√ºssen ‚Äì dies ist jedoch nie geschehen.

Die entscheidende Frage ist nun, ob die Helsana die Situation als entschuldbare Versp√§tung anerkennt oder eben nicht. Auch bei der Helsana wurde der Fall (auf Intervention der Ombudsstelle Krankenkasse) zur weiteren Pr√ºfung an die interne Rechtsabteilung weitergeleitet.  Auch hier sind weitere Abkl√§rungen in Gange.",Switzerland,swiss student visa,1,https://reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1jzptji/insured_with_swisscare_as_a_student_now_being/mtfva7t/,1747816024.0,comment,de,0.9939696788787842,"First of all, thank you for the answer. I actually wanted to update the case earlier, but I did not get there so far, as the clarifications continue and a lot is still going on. Here is a short summary of the previous course: * My girlfriend arrived in Switzerland at the beginning of September 2019. * On 24 September, an information letter on the KVG obligation was sent to her by the canton of Basel-Stadt. However, the letter could not be delivered and was returned as ineligible (as evidence is available). * On 5 November 2019, the canton of Basel-Stadt reported my girlfriend to the joint institution KVG as unsecured (information received from canton of Basel-Stadt). * The information either did not arrive at the joint institution KVG or was not processed correctly. I asked for an examination of the case afterwards or requested a subsequent exemption of the KVG-Stadt. The clarifications are still in progress. According to our understanding, a compulsory assignment to a Swiss health insurance system had to be carried out by the joint institution KVG ‚Äì however, this never happened.",True,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,1jzptji

If you have owned/used the car for at least 6 months prior the move, you do not have to pay VAT and duty. If you have owned/used it for less than 6 months you will get a customs form 15.30, which allows you to use the car for up to 24 months w/o pay VAT and duty. When the 24 months are up you have to either pay VAT and duty or export the car. If you are a temporary student, you can also use a foreign car on Form 15.30. 

From the road registrations office point of view side, you can use the car up to 12 months on foreign plates, as long as it has a valid insurance. Check with country of registration and your insurance if they are also o.k. with that. After 12 months, or if you cannot keep the car on foreign insurance you will need Swiss plates, if you want to continue to use the car. This usually also applies in case of form 15.30. If your foreign insurance does not cover you, you might get temporary [Frontier Insurance](https://www.nbi-ngf.ch/en/nvb/dokumente/grenzversicherung) before you get Swiss plates.

No doctor has recommended that I buy the supplements I take from time to time. I know that if I have cramps regularly or unexplained fatigue, i'll have to take magnesium and iron for a while.

It's important to emphasize that a healthy person who eats a balanced diet has no reason to take dietary supplements. And even if they do, the dose ingested should not exceed the recommended daily intake. With preparations sold in supermarkets, it's possible to reach toxic doses with prolonged consumption.

Vitamin C, one of the best-selling supplements, is often considered beneficial for health. It is often ingested in winter to prevent the flu, for example. However, this vitamin can be harmful to our health if the daily intake exceeds 1g per day for a prolonged period. The requirement is 75 mg per day for a woman and 90 mg per day for a man. Chronic abuse can lead to kidney toxicity in predisposed individuals, in the form of chronic kidney failure and kidney stones.

It is clear that, more often than not, taking food supplements does not fit into this trajectory. Consumers generally give in to advertising promises of better health, better performance, or simply a renewed sense of well-being thanks to products whose composition is more or less different from that of everyday foods.

Things were different in the past (~ 1960-1990), but those were the years of economic growth. Ticino was going from rural to modern. Back then, anecdotally, if you were proficient in another national language (preferably German) or even had a university degree, you were almost guaranteed a position of responsibility. Of course, it was a less sophisticated economy compared to today.


Others have explained today‚Äôs situation better than I could.

In any case the prices in Switzerland are generally much higher than in Italy on almost all the things for which you expected a good shock at the beginning. 3. Of scholarships the canton gives (unless they have changed the law up to 16000 fr a year) but I don't know how long you must be resident to be able to request it. You should send an email or call the office in charge. 4. no idea. 5. as you have generally said the borderers are not very well seen, a bit because of some of them, a bit 'cause of employers.

3 √à punito con una pena detentiva da uno a quattro anni chiunque, violando intenzionalmente norme elementari della circolazione, corre il forte rischio di causare un incidente della circolazione con feriti gravi o morti, segnatamente attraverso la grave inosservanza di un limite di velocit√†, l‚Äôeffettuazione di sorpassi temerari o la partecipazione a gare non autorizzate con veicoli a motore.

3bis In caso di infrazione secondo il capoverso 3, la pena detentiva minima di un anno pu√≤ essere ridotta in presenza di una circostanza attenuante secondo l‚Äôarticolo 48 del Codice penale238, in particolare se l‚Äôautore ha agito per motivi onorevoli.239

3ter In caso di infrazione secondo il capoverso 3, la pena pu√≤ essere una pena detentiva sino a quattro anni o una pena pecuniaria se nei dieci anni precedenti l‚Äôatto l‚Äôautore non ha subito alcuna condanna per crimini o delitti commessi nella circolazione stradale e che hanno cagionato un serio pericolo per la sicurezza altrui o il ferimento o la morte di terzi.240

4 √à considerata grave l‚Äôinosservanza di un limite di velocit√† se la velocit√† massima consentita √® superata:

Il fatto √© che in un grossa azienda Le politiche di assunzione non le fanno i manager o i team leader ma gli hr. Tu puoi passare colloqui e far innamorare il tuo potenziale capo ma qualcuno a cui non frega niente del lavoro effettivo detta le regole (e i salari). Trovare il ""giusto"" √© questione di skill, perseveranza e anche fortuna. Se non fosse per la famiglia non sarei in Ticino (e valuto seriamente di muovermi causa tasse).

Il razionale √© che cerco di non espandere le spese di famiglia oltre a 1/3 delle entrate, ovvero quello che farei con il tipico impiego ticinese (e che in caso di crisi, licenziamento etc. ovviamente finirei per dover trangugiare per qualche tempo). 

Coi dovuti adattamenti, visto che mi pare siate solo tu e la tua ragazza quindi in 2, ti consiglio di fare altrettanto.

The rational is that I try not to expand family expenses beyond 1/3 of income, that is what I would do with the typical Ticino job (and that in case of crisis, dismissal etc. obviously I would end up having to eat for some time).

mijg0bq,WesbeerZh,,"Maybe a different perspective here - I‚Äôm Swiss, M in my 30s, and I‚Äôve lived in Zurich my whole life. I‚Äôm pretty outgoing and always surrounded myself with international people, both in my 20s and now. I also run a beer tour business and work as a barkeeper in a bar with a big expat crowd, so I‚Äôve seen firsthand how people from different backgrounds experience Zurich. Plus, my wife is from Bulgaria (we met in Sofia), so I get the contrast between cultures!

Social Scene & Nightlife

Zurich definitely isn‚Äôt dead after 6 PM. There are great bars and clubs, especially in District 4 and 5, where you‚Äôll always find something going on. It's expensive, but if you know where to go, you can have a good time. You can party pretty much every day, though Wednesdays can be quieter. Some clubs stay open 48 hours straight on weekends, so the nightlife is there‚Äîyou just need to know where to look. In summer you can always hang out by the lake or the river and there will be plenty of people.

Making Friends as an Expat

This can be tough at first. A lot of Swiss people stick with their childhood friend groups and aren‚Äôt necessarily looking to expand their circles. But once you do make Swiss friends, they‚Äôre incredibly loyal and genuine. The good news is Zurich has a huge expat community, and since you‚Äôll be at ETH, you‚Äôll find people in a similar situation. Many of my international friends made their closest friends through university or expat meetups.

Dating Scene

Here I'm definitely not an expert anymore and a female perspective would anyway be better for you. But here's my take: From my perspective, Zurich is very independent and modern when it comes to dating. Traditional chivalry (paying for dates, bringing flowers, etc.) isn‚Äôt common anymore, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt find guys who do it. In general, people here split bills and prioritize equality, though you‚Äôll still find some who lean more traditional. It really depends on the individual.

Weekends & Sundays

Weekends aren‚Äôt quiet if you know where to go! But Sundays? Yeah, they‚Äôre dead. Almost all shops are closed except for train stations and gas stations, and even a lot of bars and restaurants don‚Äôt open. There are cultural activities, hikes, or brunch spots, but if you‚Äôre used to a lively Sunday, it might take some adjustment. My wife was pretty shocked by how quiet it gets.

Switzerland vs. the Netherlands

I haven‚Äôt lived in the Netherlands, but I‚Äôve visited a lot. From what I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs slightly more open to meeting new people but also not always super warm toward foreigners. Swiss people are usually polite and won‚Äôt be openly unfriendly, but they can be reserved at first. Both countries have strong expat communities, though.

Hope this helps!

layfoeo,BeldorTN,,"If German isn't your first language, it's going to be a struggle unless you are proficient. Most universities hold most of their undergrad lectures in German, so following them could be difficult for you.

ZHAW is a university of applied sciences (Fachhochschule, FH). FHs tend to be more practically oriented and focus less on the more abstract theories behind CS. That doesn't necessarily mean that they are easier, though! They usually require you to have some working experience in a related field before you enroll at the university and you will be forced to write usable code fairly quickly. So if you come from a Gymi/high school like environment you might need a couple months to adapt to that.

You still learn about the abstract theory behind what you are doing, but the foundational mathematics that are underlying the theoretical computer science principles will get neglected a bit. You also won't do a whole lot of research during undergrad, instead you will do some project work in small teams. Proper research at a FH is usually done at MSc/MSE level.



In short:

1) Make absolutely sure that your German level is good enough to follow the lectures. I'd say C2 level at least.  

2) Make sure you have some working experience in IT, Software Development or similar jobs. May be an apprenticeship or a half-year internship.  

3) Brush up on your math skills before the semester if it has been a while since you left high school or your apprenticeship. You don't want to re-learn fundamental calculus or linalg concepts while you are attending classes that build on them.",zurich,study in switzerland,2,https://reddit.com/r/zurich/comments/1drbt0i/studying_at_zhaw_experience_and_advice/layfoeo/,1719739965.0,comment,en,0.986375629901886,"If German isn't your first language, it's going to be a struggle unless you are proficient.

The *Bezirksgericht* (district court) and *Schlichtungsbeh√∂rde in Mietsachen* (the mediation tribunal you could appeal to before you go to costly court) offer free of charge legal advice of 15 minutes.  
  
They can advise you on whether it's worth it to take your neighbours and your landlord to mediation tribunal on this.

Important: Bring documentation. Pictures of the damage, bills & receipts for things you bought, records of your email exchange with neighbours & landlord, etc.   
  
And they can give you tips on strongly worded registered letters you could send to both about this to make your case. Phone calls are not usually effective in this kind of situation, as you learned when everyone told you they aren't going to pay. So make a point of leaving a paper trail, because that signals that you are willing to go to the authorities with this, and they will likely only respond if you send a letter, preferably registered, because of this. Hence, get tips on how to word a registered letter.

 **3. Insurance for the future** 

As everyone is saying in unison, please get insurance for the future.  

* Household contents insurance (*Hausratversicherung*) covers your own stuff if it gets damaged or stolen by others
* Liability insurance (*Haftpflichtversicherung*) covers other people's things if you damage someone else's stuff.

Both are usually offered in a combined insurance model.  
  
That combination makes sense for this kind of scenario, where there are three legal parties involved, the landlord, the neighbour, and you.  
  
Your own stuff got damaged (that would be covered by household contents beyond your *Selbstbehalt*).

The landlord's flat (and it is their flat, not yours, you are just renting it, and are liable to them as a renter for damages to the flat) may also have got damaged (wall paint, mold, issues with the piping...), so someone will at some point be held liable, presumably first the neighbour, and for your flat at some point possibly also you if there's long term damage.

The whole point with having liability & household contents insurance is that if the neighbour or their liability insurance says they won't pay, and/or the landlord or their insurance says they won't pay, then your insurance would then start putting pressure on the other people's insurance on your behalf.

**4. Students' association**  
You say you are a student.  
Universities in Switzerland all have students' associations.  
  
The student association at University of Z√ºrich for example has a legal counselling service:

mjihyzs,SwissMathsTeacher,,"**Hoi!**

Die erforderlichen Leistungen/Leistungskontrollen sind ziemlich unterschiedlich. Ich habe das LD an der ETH gemacht.

An der UZH gibt es insbesondere eine ""gef√ºrchtete"" Abschlusspr√ºfung in EW, f√ºr die man scheinbar sehr viele lange B√ºcher lesen muss. An der ETH war die Abschlusspr√ºfung ein kurzes Gespr√§ch mit Prof. Stern, bei dem es thematisch um ein vorher bekanntgegebenes Buch und einen vorher bekanntgegebenen Artikel ging. 

An der ETH kannst/musst du noch weitere ECTS in deinem Fach belegen (also nicht LD-spezifisch), an der UZH gab es das damals nicht, sondern die ECTS werden rein mit EW/FD/Praktika gef√ºllt. Wenn du fachlich interessiert (und stark) bist, ist da ETH sicher von Vorteil.

Der grosse Nachteil an der ETH: Die Praktikumslehrpersonen werden dir im Normalfall zugewiesen. Der Pool von ""von der ETH abgesegneten"" Praktikumslehrpersonen ist ziemlich klein, wenn du Pech hast, k√∂nnte der Reiseweg daf√ºr ziemlich lang sein. Auch wird dir bisherige Berufserfahrung nicht angerechnet - soweit ich weiss, kann man an der UZH das Praktikum verk√ºrzen lassen, je nach Berufserfahrung.

At ETH you can/must prove further ECTS in your subject (so not LD-specific), at UZH there was not at that time, but the ECTS are filled purely with EW/FD/practicals. If you are interested in the subject (and strong), ETH is certainly of advantage. The big disadvantage at ETH: the internship instructors are normally assigned to you. The pool of ""beneficient"" internship instructors is quite small, if you have bad luck, the journey could be quite long for it.

jsg5lon,souldap,,"Welcome to Switzerland and glad you chose EPFL!
One thing to know is that studying at EPFL requires a lot of work, so unless you have semesters with few classes or are extremely talended, you'll spend most of weekdays either studying, in class or working on various projects. So spending time commuting each day won't be worth it.

Let's say you find a place directly in the mountains, such as in Verbier: if you leave at 5pm from EPFL (optimistic), you'll be there at 7pm, it will already be dark for the majority of the year, so no opportunity to go outside.

Best solution imo is to find a place in Lausanne, preferably near the train station. From there you can commute to EPFL in max 15 minutes by bike and enjoy a peaceful daily ride near the lake. And on weekends/your free days, you're close to the trains, which take you directly to the main nearby Alpine cities (Montreux, Martigny, Sion, Aigle, etc.). From there it's only a few more km by bus to reach the best hiking/skiing spots.

Find some friends with similar interests at EPFL and join them for some activities. You can look for the ""Club Montagne EPFL"". If some have a car you'll be more flexible regarding potential destinations, but the train+bus combo is already more than enough to cover a whole year of hiking and skiing.

Get a 1/2 tarif (half price pass) at least, it will be worth it after 2 or 3 train rides.

Download the Swisstopo app. You can find all hiking trails, draw tours in advance, it's the best app you can find and it's free. Works for bicycling too.

If you're expecting tons of snow, it's good to know that we've had several consecutive years of poor snow at lower altitude now. This year we could hike on foot at 2200m in January, and early March was already springtime. Fair to good snow at 2700-3000m all winter long though. You can usually hike on foot until October - mid-November, that's also when you get the best sunsets and the most beautiful colors in trees.

Last tip, don't dismiss the Jura mountains (Vall√©e de Joux, Le Suchet, Aiguilles de Baulmes for rock climbing, Creux du Van...), especially when it's early spring and the alps are still under melting snow. It's a beautiful region too, you get great views of the Alps, and it's perfect for hiking, or snowshoeing, especially when the danger of avalanche in the Alps is high.

fc539pw,FreakyLeakyLemon,,"Pour les v√™tements √† porter, les autres commentaires ont bien r√©pondu.

Pour les activit√©s de ton temps libre, je te conseille des promenades au bord du lac √† Ouchy/Vidy (puisque tu ne seras pas tr√®s loin avec l'universit√©). Dans cette p√©riode, trouver des activit√©s int√©ressantes dans la ville est difficile, il y a la cath√©drale, il y a Aquatis ([https://www.aquatis.ch/#visiter](https://www.aquatis.ch/#visiter)), le mus√©e olympique ([https://www.olympic.org/fr/musee/visiter/infos-pratiques](https://www.olympic.org/fr/musee/visiter/infos-pratiques)). Sinon, des concerts et des spectacles ([https://www.docks.ch/](https://www.docks.ch/) ou [http://www.sallemetropole.ch/](http://www.sallemetropole.ch/)) ou le cin√©ma ([https://pathe.ch/fr/cinema-lausanne/films-prochainement.html#/](https://pathe.ch/fr/cinema-lausanne/films-prochainement.html#/)).

Tu trouveras s√ªrement des personnes √† l'universit√© qui pourront te conseiller sur diff√©rentes activit√©s. 

Si tu aimes te promener et que tu es pr√™te √† aller en dehors de la ville de Lausanne : Morges, Montreux, Vevey sont des villes avec un tr√®s beau bord de lac.

Si tu veux d√©couvrir des sp√©cialit√©s culinaires et changer de paysage : La ville de Gruy√®re dans le canton du Valais ([https://www.la-gruyere.ch/fr/Z9351/gruyeres](https://www.la-gruyere.ch/fr/Z9351/gruyeres)) est magnifique. En plus, si tu aimes le film Alien, il y a le mus√©e HR Giger ([https://www.la-gruyere.ch/fr/Z10276/giger](https://www.la-gruyere.ch/fr/Z10276/giger)).

Ce que j'aime beaucoup faire pendant cette p√©riode c'est aller dans des bains thermaux : √† Saillon ([https://www.bainsdesaillon.ch/bains/centre-thermal/](https://www.bainsdesaillon.ch/bains/centre-thermal/)) ou encore Lavey ([https://www.bains-lavey.ch/fr/](https://www.bains-lavey.ch/fr/)).

Et enfin, je dirai qu'aller en montagne profiter de la neige pour skier ou faire du snowboard et manger une fondue ou une raclette est id√©al pour ton s√©jour en Suisse. Il y a beaucoup de destinations possibles pour √ßa, le mieux est de voir en fonction de ton budget et mon conseil c'est que tu pr√©pares des v√™tements chauds (bonnet, gants, √©charpe, combinaison de ski) si tu veux aller en montagne (un example : [http://www.ovronnaz.ch/](http://www.ovronnaz.ch/)).

J'habite moi-m√™me √† Lausanne, je reste disponible par MP si tu as besoin.

Regarding clothes, the other comments answered quite well your question.

Now for the activities during your spare time, if you like going out for a walk, we have a lot of nice lakeside promenades, Ouchy, Vidy just to mention the nearest ones (Vidy is right next to the university). If you prefer inside activities, check my links about Aquatis and the Olympic Museum. There's also the Lausanne's Cathedral you can visit.

You'll surely find people in the uni who can also give you some advice.

If you're ready to leave Lausanne and go check a few other cities, Morges, Montreux and Vevey are great places with a nice lakeside promenade too.

If you want to discover local food and change views, I definitely suggest visiting Gruy√®re in canton Valais. It's a beautiful city (Medieval town) and you'll find my favorite homemade dessert: Meringue √† la double cr√®me. Plus if you like the Alien movies, there's the Giger Museum.

In the period you're coming, my favorite thing to do is swimming in the thermal pools, we have two great ones which are in Saillon and Lavey.

Finally, I'd say that going up in the mountains for skiing/snowboarding is ideal, you'll have great views, fresh air, and eating a raclette or a fondue (or just drink hot chocolate) is awesome (just note that nearly everything you buy in the mountains is sometimes twice its usual cost if you compare it with Lausanne for example, so keep your budget in mind).

mv8wepn,mickynuts,,"R√©ponse donn√©e. Mais on voit clairement l'orientation sur la vente et ce qui nous ferait acheter. J'ai d√©j√† eu √ßa avec Qualipro.

Et votre derni√®re question n'inclut pas de r√©ponses comme ""rien"" ou pas de r√©ponse. Parce qu'aucune des r√©ponses ne me convenait. C'est clairement orient√©. Tout comme Qualipro qui avait aussi des choix identiques aux v√¥tres, ce qui ne laisse pas de place √† des r√©ponses comme rien ou sans r√©ponse/ne s'applique pas.

Donc j'ai d√ª choisir par le m√©decin ou l'expert.

""Quel type de contenu sur les r√©seaux sociaux vous inciterait le plus √† acheter un compl√©ment alimentaire ? (S√©lectionnez toutes les r√©ponses qui s'appliquent)""

Si votre sondage est utilis√© par des entreprises qui vont mettre en avant les r√©ponses √† cette question. Elle aura des avis biais√©s car les gens qui veulent aller jusqu'au bout sont oblig√©s de r√©pondre √† l'une des affirmations.

Aucun m√©decin ne m'a recommand√© d'acheter les compl√©ments que je prends de temps en temps. Je sais que si j'ai des crampes r√©guli√®rement ou une fatigue inexpliqu√©e, je devrai prendre du magn√©sium et du fer pendant un certain temps.

Mais les √©tudes sont claires, les effets de ces compl√©ments sont assez clairs. C'est presque inutile.

Citation [
Il est important de souligner qu'une personne en bonne sant√© qui suit une alimentation √©quilibr√©e n'a aucune raison de prendre des compl√©ments alimentaires. Et m√™me si elle le fait, la dose ing√©r√©e ne doit pas d√©passer l'apport quotidien recommand√©. Avec les pr√©parations vendues en supermarch√©, il est possible d'atteindre des doses toxiques avec une consommation prolong√©e.

La vitamine C, l'un des compl√©ments les plus vendus, est souvent consid√©r√©e comme b√©n√©fique pour la sant√©. Elle est souvent ing√©r√©e en hiver pour pr√©venir la grippe, par exemple. Cependant, cette vitamine peut √™tre nocive pour notre sant√© si l'apport quotidien d√©passe 1 g par jour pendant une p√©riode prolong√©e. Le besoin est de 75 mg par jour pour une femme et de 90 mg par jour pour un homme. L'abus chronique peut entra√Æner une toxicit√© r√©nale chez les personnes pr√©dispos√©es, sous forme d'insuffisance r√©nale chronique et de calculs r√©naux.

Tout d'abord, c'est du marketing. Ils peuvent aider avec les r√©gimes pour compl√©ter un apport insuffisant parce que la nourriture ne serait pas support√©e par la personne. Mais √† part √ßa. Ils sont souvent inutiles, voire dangereux.
Citation [
Il est clair que, le plus souvent, la prise de compl√©ments alimentaires ne s'inscrit pas dans cette trajectoire. Les consommateurs c√®dent g√©n√©ralement aux promesses publicitaires d'une meilleure sant√©, de meilleures performances, ou simplement d'un sentiment de bien-√™tre renouvel√© gr√¢ce √† des produits dont la composition est plus ou moins diff√©rente de celle des aliments du quotidien.
]

[
En conclusion, il appara√Æt que la consommation de compl√©ments alimentaires n‚Äôest¬†pas un acte anodin. Sa banalisation conduit certains consommateurs √† s‚Äôexposer √† des risques sanitaires pour un b√©n√©fice incertain. Loin de proscrire tout recours aux compl√©ments alimentaires, l‚ÄôAnses plaide en faveur d‚Äôun¬†usage raisonn√©, au regard des besoins r√©els des consommateurs qui le plus souvent peuvent r√©√©quilibrer leur alimentation en modifiant leurs habitudes alimentaires. Dans ce contexte, toute prise de compl√©ment alimentaire devrait √™tre pr√©alablement¬†discut√©e avec un professionnel de sant√©.

But it's also difficult for them to prioritize: in general, the library is used to consult material physically present in the library.

Pour la m√©decine √† Lausanne mon copain a fait son Bachelor l√† et il est en Master maintenant.

In terms of area the most important thing is probably public transport, and distance to the university, and buying a cheap bicycle is probably also worth it.  
[https://velomarkt.ch/](https://velomarkt.ch/)

Cycling in the Bern region is \*very\* nice in my opinion, and we have official cycling paths across the entire country:  
[https://map.veloland.ch/?lang=en&resolution=12.76&E=2596543&N=1201400&layers=Veloland](https://map.veloland.ch/?lang=en&resolution=12.76&E=2596543&N=1201400&layers=Veloland)  
I especially like to ride around the Wohlensee.  
And in summer going swimming in the Aare (possibly with a local) or going down using a boat or standup paddle board is also very common and nice.

If you plan to travel a lot, a GA can be worth it (basically all public transport free), otherwise just a half-fare card, or a half-fare plus. But you definitely need the SBB app in Switzerland (and you can turn off the rare ads in the settings)

In terms of area the most important thing is probably public transport, and distance to the university, and buying a cheap bicycle is probably also worth it.

Cycling in the Bern region is \*very\* nice in my opinion, and we have official cycling paths across the entire country:

I especially like to ride around the Wohlensee.  
And in summer going swimming in the Aare (possibly with a local) or going down using a boat or standup paddle board is also very common and nice.

If you plan to travel a lot, a GA can be worth it (basically all public transport free), otherwise just a half-fare card, or a half-fare plus. But you definitely need the SBB app in Switzerland (and you can turn off the rare ads in the settings)

√úbertriebenes Beispiel? Jein, der pers√∂nliche CO2-Fussabdruck wurde von BP propagiert, um die Verantwortung f√ºr die Umweltverschmutzung auf die Verbraucher abzuw√§lzen.

Dadurch werden sie teilweise sogar extremisiert und schlagen ins Gegenteil √ºber (ich denke NIEMAND ist gegen bessere Luft zum Atmen, mehr Gr√ºn und ein harmonischerer Umgang mit der Natur --> Vorsicht, No-True-Scotsman-Argument :P).

Zwei Punkte sind mir hier wirklich wichtig (und wenn ""nur"" du, derjenigewelcher1, das liest, reicht mir das :), schreibe vielleicht nur f√ºr mein Gewissen, who knows...):

* Wenn man im System ist (also Normalo-Lohn, Normalo-Leben), ist es extrem schwierig, sich ""richtig"" zu verhalten. Das ist ein riesen Dilemma, welches schwer zu ertragen ist.  
Was ""richtig"" ist, ist oft subject to change, aber einiges kann und darf nicht mehr diskutiert werden, daf√ºr ist die Zeit vorbei.
* Man kann, nein, du darfst von der Politik und den Verursachern verlangen, dass sie am System etwas √§ndern, auch wenn du dich im System bewegst und dadurch nicht perfekt bist. Niemand ist perfekt und das darf keine Bedingung sein, dass man von den Politikern, welche das Volk vertreten sollen, dass sie etwas √§ndern und ins Rollen bringen.
* Wenn wir netter zueinander sind, dann fallen viele Reibungs- und Streitpunkte zwischen ""Links"" und ""Rechts"" oder anderen Ideologien weg. Es wird weniger Polarisierung geben und der Dialog wird konstruktiv bleiben.

n3tzeb6,Vilokys,,"Si tu as un dipl√¥me en logistique, ne cherche pas √† travailler en d√©p√¥t. Travaille directement dans les bureaux du d√©p√¥t.

Les d√©p√¥ts sont effectivement l√† pour les gens avec peu de dipl√¥me mais on peut facilement monter dans les √©chelons si on est pas trop b√™te et un peu d√©termin√©. J'ai commenc√© il y a 7 ans comme pr√©parateur de commande en base GMS, sans aucun dipl√¥me. Apr√®s un an, j'ai r√©ussi √† √™tre r√©ceptionnaire logistique puis au bout de 3 ans, responsable d'un service de prepa. Aujourd'hui, j'ai chang√© d'entreprise et je suis en contr√¥le de gestion et commerce. Sans aucun dipl√¥me, juste ce que j'ai appris au fur et √† mesure. Et je suis bon sur Excel aussi. C'est un vrai atout.

Aussi, ne confond pas peu d'exp pro avec peu de dipl√¥me car un mec avec 5 ans d'exp en d√©p√¥t en saura bien plus que toi sur tout le fonctionnement de la cha√Æne logistique interne malgr√© tes √©tudes.

Il faut aussi se dire que tout le monde bosse diff√©rement. Que ce soit les fournisseurs, les transporteurs, les bases GMS... Tous vont faire diff√©rement car ils auront des outils et des contraintes diff√©rentes.

Donc pour r√©pondre √† ta question :

Work directly in the depot offices. The depots are actually there for people with little degree but you can easily climb in the ranks if you're not too stupid and a little determined.

Today, I've changed business and I'm in management control and business. Without any degree, just what I learned as I did. And I'm good on Excel too. It's a real asset. So, don't confuse little expro with little degree because a guy with 5 years of ex-deposit will know much more than you on all the functioning of the internal logistics chain despite your studies. You also have to say that everyone works differently. Whether it's suppliers, carriers, the GMS bases...

n0qwvaz,Jenkouille,,"Pour le coup, l'argumentaire est ici parfaitement vrai, je te rejoins. Mais c'est aussi ici que se situe l'un des b√©mols principaux du F-35: la stricte neutralit√© et le besoin d'une arm√©e solide - ce qu'est la Suisse - implique non seulement le mat√©riel, mais aussi l'implantation locale d'une infrastructure de support.

Le F-18 est un exemple notable justement. C'est certes appareil achet√© sur √©tag√®re (et pas assembl√© sous licence comme le furent pas mal de blind√©s), mais la maintenance m√™me lourde √©tait faite localement (via la RUAG je crois), avec des capacit√©s √† travailler sur la structure et l'avionique.

Sur le F-35, √¢ moins que les Suisses aient obtenus des conditions √† l'Isra√©lienne, t'auras beau avoir un appareil qui est probablement sup√©rieur √† ce qui se fait de mieux en Europe (n'en d√©plaise aux Rafalophiles, ou aux concurrents tout √† fait honn√™tes que sont l'Eurofighter et le Gripen), entre les fournitures de pi√®ces, le syst√®me de maintenance via les US, le fait de d√©pendre d'infrastructures britanniques ou Italiennes pour r√©viser les avions...

But it is also here that one of the main flats of the F-35 is located: the strict neutrality and the need for a solid army - what is Switzerland - involves not only the equipment, but also the local installation of a support infrastructure. The F-18 is a notable example precisely. It is certainly a device bought on shelf (and not assembled under license as were quite a lot of tanks), but the maintenance even heavy was done locally (via the RUAG I believe), with the ability to work on the structure and avionics. In short, still 'need to access the manufacturer parts for the top of the basket, but all coming can be done in relative autonomy. On the F-35, unless the Swiss have obtained conditions to the Israeli, you will have to have a device that is probably superior to what is best done in Europe (not displeased by the Rafalophiles, or the competitors all to the fact that it is necessary to re-define the parts, the British does not rely on the maintenance, the US, and the Griper system is probably superior to what is done in Europe (not to repair the parts, the Swiss, but not to re-compens.",True,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,1loyy0v

¬´¬†Il y a eu une tendance sur les r√©seaux sociaux autour des rallyes √† la fin du mois de d√©cembre¬†¬ª, confirme Ana√Øs, 16¬†ans, qui pr√©f√®re taire son nom de famille. En premi√®re g√©n√©rale dans un lyc√©e priv√© √† Vannes, son avenir est d√©j√† tout trac√©¬†: licence d‚Äôadministration √©conomique et sociale √† l‚ÄôInstitut catholique de Rennes, mast√®re ¬´¬†immobilier¬†: responsable d‚Äôaffaires¬†¬ª √† l‚ÄôESG et cr√©ation de son entreprise.

Son int√©gration dans un rallye semblait √©galement √©crite¬†: ¬´¬†Ma m√®re y √©tait inscrite, m√™me chose pour mes grands-parents. Il s‚Äôagit un peu d‚Äôune tradition.¬†¬ª Depuis ses 12¬†ans, la jeune fille issue de la noblesse fait partie de ce club ferm√© dans lequel on ne peut entrer sans √™tre recommand√©¬†: ¬´¬†Nous avons pratiquement tous re√ßu la m√™me √©ducation et avons les m√™mes centres d‚Äôint√©r√™t.¬†¬ª Sur TikTok (plus de 12 0000 abonn√©s), l‚Äôex-scoute parle de sa peur des animaux empaill√©s, de sa foi catholique et de ses d√©ceptions amoureuses. ¬´¬†Ma dignit√© apr√®s avoir pleur√© pour un mec qui pensait que je faisais des rallyes de voitures¬†¬ª, ironise-t-elle dans l‚Äôun de ses posts.

Sous la surveillance des parents
M√©connues du grand public, ces associations voient le jour dans les ann√©es 1950. Elles portent le nom des courses automobiles en r√©f√©rence au bal qui se tenait √† la fin de celles-ci. Les enfants de la noblesse ou de grandes fortunes s‚Äôy retrouvent.

Ces groupes priv√©s sont li√©s ¬´¬†au choc de la seconde guerre mondiale¬†¬ª et √† ¬´¬†l‚Äô√©cole rendue obligatoire, car les enfants de ce milieu, qui avaient jusque-l√† plut√¥t tendance √† b√©n√©ficier du pr√©ceptorat √† domicile, se retrouvaient m√©lang√©s aux autres classes sociales¬†¬ª, analyse Monique Pin√ßon-Charlot, coautrice de l‚Äôouvrage Les Ghettos du gotha (Seuil, 2007). La sociologue poursuit¬†: ¬´¬†C‚Äôest √©vident que les rallyes accentuent les in√©galit√©s, cela fait une troisi√®me instance de socialisation, en plus de la famille et de l‚Äô√©cole. Ils viennent multiplier les chances d‚Äôune endogamie parfaite, servent √† √©viter les m√©salliances.¬†¬ª

Difficile d‚Äôobtenir le nombre exact de rallyes en France, ceux-ci n‚Äô√©tant pas r√©pertori√©s et la plupart vivant le temps d‚Äôune g√©n√©ration seulement. Mais le Bottin mondain en recense ¬´¬†une trentaine √† Paris, explique Cl√©mence de Clavi√®re, directrice de l‚Äôannuaire des familles de la soci√©t√© mondaine.¬†Il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun moyen pour les parents d‚Äôapprendre √† leur enfant la vie en soci√©t√©¬†¬ª. A la t√™te de ces clubs, des m√®res de famille qui tiennent √† rester discr√®tes et dont d√©pend l‚Äôorientation du rallye.

Si des r√®gles surann√©es se maintiennent, le but affich√© a √©t√© d√©poussi√©r√©. A l‚Äô√©poque, ces bals √©taient con√ßus pour rencontrer un ou une partenaire. A entendre les adolescents, soixante-dix ans plus tard, l‚Äôobjectif a chang√©. ¬´¬†On ne veut plus trouver un conjoint, mais faire la f√™te dans des soir√©es encadr√©es¬†¬ª, assure Valentine Bau, 17¬†ans.

Sous la surveillance des parents, ces r√©ceptions constituent l‚Äôultime √©tape d‚Äôun parcours tr√®s quadrill√©. Elles arrivent apr√®s une s√©rie d‚Äôactivit√©s organis√©es par palier selon les √¢ges¬†: visites culturelles, bowling, escalade et cours de danse. Parfois en non-mixit√©. La jeune Bordelaise, passionn√©e d‚Äôart dramatique, qui voit son futur se dessiner dans le commerce, se souvient de la tenue qu‚Äôelle portait lors de sa premi√®re soir√©e en d√©cembre¬†2022¬†: robe bustier noire et gants blancs. ¬´¬†Le th√®me, c‚Äô√©tait [le ‚ÄúJames Bond‚Äù] Casino Royale.¬†¬ª Son p√®re, chef d‚Äôentreprise et membre d‚Äôun rallye strasbourgeois dans les ann√©es 1980, appuie ses propos¬†: ¬´¬†√áa leur √©vite de faire de mauvaises rencontres.¬†¬ª

De 5¬†000¬†√† 10¬†000¬†euros par enfant
De l√† √† ce que les parents choisissent le ou la partenaire de danse, il n‚Äôy a qu‚Äôun pas. ¬´¬†On avait des cavali√®res un peu officieuses, d√©cid√©es par les parents, mais cela n‚Äôengageait √† rien¬†¬ª, se souvient Pierre-Alexis, 28¬†ans, dont le pr√©nom a √©t√© modifi√© pour pr√©server son anonymat. Issu d‚Äôune famille noble, il grandit dans le 6e arrondissement de Paris et √©tudie dans l‚Äôun des lyc√©es priv√©s les plus hupp√©s du 16e.

A l‚Äô√¢ge de 15¬†ans, il coche toutes les cases pour int√©grer le rallye parisien Quadrille, qu‚Äôil d√©crit comme ¬´¬†un peu s√©lect¬†¬ª. A l‚Äôint√©rieur, des aristocrates se retrouvent entre eux¬†: ¬´¬†Quand tu as une particule en France, ce n‚Äôest pas reconnu, alors qu‚Äôen Allemagne ton titre de noblesse est sur ta carte d‚Äôidentit√©. En France, la noblesse a besoin de structure pour se dire qu‚Äôelle existe.¬†¬ª Au Quadrille, ¬´¬†l‚Äôimportance donn√©e √† l‚Äôhistoire, √† la foi chr√©tienne et √† la gastronomie¬†¬ª l‚Äôemporte sur l‚Äôargent qui ¬´¬†n‚Äôest pas la priorit√©¬†¬ª. Cependant, le co√ªt de ces r√©ceptions parisiennes oscille entre 5¬†000¬†et 10¬†000 euros par enfant. Location de la salle, traiteur, s√©curit√©, transport‚Ä¶ En effet, ces soir√©es visent un certain standing et les parents doivent souvent s‚Äôy mettre √† plusieurs pour les organiser.


Vu de Nantes, Charlotte, 28¬†ans, juge les rallyes parisiens trop clinquants. ¬´¬†Nous, on se¬†d√©guisait ou l‚Äôon portait des robes Camaieu ou Zara, on ressemblait plus √† des fillettes¬†¬ª, plaisante la jeune femme issue d‚Äôun milieu catholique. Inscrite dans un rallye de ses 15¬†ans √†¬†ses 18¬†ans, elle √©voque des soir√©es sans champagne, avec des cocktails maison. Oubli√©s les vigiles qui tapissent les recoins d‚Äôun ch√¢teau ou d‚Äôune bo√Æte de nuit, ¬´¬†seulement quatre adultes, pour trente ou quarante enfants¬†¬ª, qui se chargeaient de la surveillance. Un contr√¥le jug√© insuffisant avec ¬´¬†des jeunes souvent ivres¬†¬ª, se rem√©more Charlotte.

Si ces soir√©es perdurent, ¬´¬†c‚Äôest pour leur dimension festive. On y boit beaucoup et l‚Äôon ne danse pas uniquement des slows, compl√®te Sophie Louey, sociologue √† Sciences Po Paris, qui a travaill√© sur l‚Äôengagement dans les collectifs patronaux de la part des chefs d‚Äôentreprise, dont certains ont fr√©quent√© les rallyes et leurs enfants √† leur tour. Ces soir√©es sont plus ouvertes qu‚Äôavant, car elles permettent d‚Äôinviter des camarades de classe qui ne sont pas du cru¬†¬ª.

Robe pour les filles, costume pour les gar√ßons
Mais derri√®re l‚Äôimage d√©tendue v√©hicul√©e par les r√©seaux sociaux, certains st√©r√©otypes de genre ont la vie dure¬†: ¬´¬†Robe et talons exig√©s pour les filles et costume pour les gar√ßons. La question de la non-binarit√© ne se pose m√™me pas¬†¬ª, pr√©cise Sophie Louey.

Dans cette atmosph√®re h√©t√©ronorm√©e, les gar√ßons doivent souvent jouer les cavaliers d‚Äôun autre √¢ge en invitant les filles √† danser. ¬´¬†C‚Äôest dommage, je pense que cela a cr√©√© pas mal de complexes du c√¥t√© des adolescentes¬†¬ª, soupire Charlotte, qui aurait pr√©f√©r√© prendre les devants avec ses copains.

e81tpvc,huazzy,,"This is why I always recommend people buy the Legal Aid Insurance! It's like 300 CHF a year but protects you from things of this sort.

Unfortunately you're likely not going to win this battle without legal help, which will likely cost you more than the 2K the fines would total. I know someone that encountered something very similar (car was driven by a family member without his permission) and the police basically said ""figure it out yourself"" and kept him liable. Likewise, the canton will also advise you to pay it and then dispute it yourself.

On another note- remember that you could be facing a lot more fines that just haven't arrived. So don't just focus on the 4 fines and brace for the worst. Make sure you cover yourself for the whole period.

Good luck though, keep us posted.",AskEurope,swiss student visa,3,https://reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/9pbmfm/i_am_an_international_student_in_switzerland_i/e81tpvc/,1539935309.0,comment,en,0.9935338497161865,"This is why I always recommend people buy the Legal Aid Insurance!
