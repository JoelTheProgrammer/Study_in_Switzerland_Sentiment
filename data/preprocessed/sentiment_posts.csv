1lqsy9q,TuraNurI,Best way to study Master‚Äôs in Journalism/Media/Communication in Switzerland?,"Hi
I‚Äôm from Bangladesh and looking for guidance on how to apply for scholarships, fully or partially funded programs to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree in Journalism, Media, or Mass Communication in Switzerland.

My background: ‚Ä¢	Bachelor‚Äôs in Mass Communication and Journalism from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh (CGPA 3.09 out of 4) ‚Ä¢	IELTS score: 7.0 ‚Ä¢	4 years of experience in reputed media houses in Bangladesh, working as a sub-editor and reporter

I‚Äôm also open to related programs like media studies, communication, or digital communication.

Are there specific universities (like the University of Zurich, University of Geneva, or others) that offer relevant programs in English?

Any tips for strengthening my application given my moderate GPA?

Do I need to learn any local language (German, French, Italian) to apply or thrive in the program?

1ki9a74,MFeee_,Family no longer supports my study abroad plan ‚Äî are there any low-cost exit routes left for me?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 22-year-old woman from China (only child, working-class family in a provincial capital city). I‚Äôve wanted to move abroad for years, and my family was originally supportive, offering to help with around **400,000‚Äì500,000 RMB (\~$55,000‚Äì70,000 USD)** for my education. But recently, they suddenly changed their minds ‚Äî now I feel stuck, and I‚Äôm not sure what options I still have.

My background:

* Graduated from a 3-year college in China 3 years ago (associate degree)
* Recently completed a self-taught bachelor‚Äôs degree (to meet the requirements for a master‚Äôs abroad)
* Planned to study computer science abroad, get a master‚Äôs, then find a job and stay
* Have been stuck at IELTS 6.0, which caused me to miss deadlines for schools I really wanted (especially in Denmark)
* Applied last-minute to two universities in the German-speaking region of Switzerland (also computer science), hoping I could improve my German and eventually work in Germany ‚Äî but haven‚Äôt heard back yet

What went wrong:

Now I‚Äôm facing pressure both inside and outside:

1. Internally**:** My study plans got delayed due to language scores. I missed key deadlines and still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get accepted by the Swiss universities.
2. Externally**:** My mom suddenly became extremely anxious about me going abroad, especially as a woman. Relatives keep telling her that ‚Äúabroad is dangerous,‚Äù ‚Äúforeign degrees are useless,‚Äù etc., and she‚Äôs now completely against it. My dad used to support me, but after endless arguments at home, he‚Äôs given up too.

My dilemma:

I still really want to move abroad in the next 1‚Äì2 years. But now:

* I don‚Äôt have strong technical skills or job experience
* My family has withdrawn both emotional and financial support
* I‚Äôm not sure if the ‚Äústudy master‚Äôs ‚Üí job ‚Üí stay‚Äù route is still possible for me
* I don‚Äôt know what other **low-cost, low-barrier** options might exist

Question:

Are there any other realistic pathways people like me (young, limited work experience, non-STEM elite, little support) have taken to get out?

Examples I‚Äôm considering but know little about:

* Work holiday visa (seems hard for Chinese passport?)
* Volunteering programs
* Au pair or cultural exchange
* Language assistant jobs
* Other unconventional paths?

1. FINMA approved Bank account: I currently have a Bank of America account. I'm a little unsure on if it's FINMA approved.

* I know Chase Bank if fully FINMA approved ( as far as I know, banking is not my expertise), but I would rather not have to open separate bank account if my B of A account is actually sufficient.

1. Housing accommodations: My program won't start until Fall semester which is a ways away (3.5 months away), and I am currently trying to find an apartment but do not have one yet.

I‚Äôm currently majoring in psychology at a small private university in Switzerland. It‚Äôs super expensive and honestly, the academics have revealed themselves to be repugnant. I originally wanted to major in chemistry or astrophysics, but the school only offers two science majors, including psychology.  I was planning to minor in math, but the university makes it almost impossible to graduate in 4 years, so I decided against it. I‚Äôm on the pre-med track and hope to graduate in 3 years.

The problem is that to continue here, I‚Äôll have to take out huge private loans. Sallie Mae is the only lender for international schools, and I‚Äôve already taken out a $36,000 private loan that my family isn‚Äôt paying for, so it‚Äôll just keep growing until I graduate. I come from a single-income household and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Side note I am trapped in a labrynth of suffering being at this school. It is like each person I meet here is a parody version of different variations of rich kids. I was also violently sexually assaulted the second week I was here and have been ostracized since. Anywho. I thought I‚Äôd get more aid, but the longer I‚Äôm here, the more I realize this university won‚Äôt give me more aid and actively attempts to keep students for a 5th year to make more money.

1kblccg,Ill_Nobody_2726,The Swiss University System compared to other countries',"Hey there.

Swiss-born undergrad law student here. I have felt the need to rant about my country's university system for a while so I guess I will do it on this subreddit. Sorry about this long rant but it should be cathartic to me.

I graduated high School as the valedictorian with the best GPA of all students at my school 5.71/6.0 (18,84/20). I wanted to pursue a career in investment banking or venture capital. To do that, in Switzerland, it is almost a requirement to go to HSG St.Gallen. Everyone can get into the school but the issue is that you have to find an accommodation on your own. There is no campus accommodation. With the Swiss logement crisis there are very few apartment available which shoot the rent price up. I come from a working class family, there is no way we can afford a full rent for a studio but we are not poor enough to access emergency funds. I wouldn't want for my family to pay anyway. It seems that in most countries you can either get a merit-based scholarship or take a loan. Also, I have social anxiety so living with strangers in WG scares me a lot and it is barely cheaper.

In Switzerland, student loans are not practiced and merit-based scholarships are non-existent. So I had to give up my dream just because I couldn't afford it and it sucks. People in my high school who barely graduated can go there and not me. It just pisses me off. I feel like I worked so hard in high school and it paid off to nothing whereas were I born somewhere else I would have been more successful.

I hate that in Switzerland everyone is just expected to go to their state school, I feel like in most other countries it is common to have top-tier universities and students from all the country go there. Like what's the point of working so hard in high school if it is not to go to the best university possible. I disincentives excellence. Also, I am 23. I don't wanna live with my parents nor stay in my city but I don't have the choice. I work part time in customer service, half my salary, would go to my rent and tenant usually require you to earn 3x the rent price.

Right now I am doing a law degree in my third year and absolutely hate it. I don't want to work in the law field but chose it by default since Fribourg University, where I live, has a good reputation for law but not for business nor finance. No bank would have hired me with a degree from here. I feel lost and broken and angry.

1m5swke,Local_Raspberry_1889,Insurance as an Intern from the EU,"Hi everyone,

I am from Austria and currently doing a 6-month internship in Neuch√¢tel (since 2 months). I got a letter from the canton that I will have to sign up for insurance as expected.

I have found that Swisscare could be adequate, but when I try to sign up for it it doesn't allow it saying:

*""You are not eligible for student insurance plan. You are required to have the Swiss KVG-LAMal health insurance.""*

The strange thing is that if I select another canton or change my country of origin to a non-EU country, it allows me to proceed with taking out insurance. Is there a special rule that Neuch√¢tel has so that EU students/interns can't be exempted from having a Swiss insurance provider and therefore can't use Swisscare, or why is this?

I‚Äôm an international student living in Switzerland and recently ran into a stressful situation with my residence permit application. I‚Äôd love to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and how it turned out.

I‚Äôve been living in Switzerland legally since 2021. I studied at EPFL in Lausanne and now I‚Äôm enrolled at ETH Z√ºrich for the current academic year. When I applied for my new EU/EFTA residence permit in Zurich, I unfortunately had some issues with acquiring letters and forgot to submit some important documents ‚Äî specifically, proof of enrollment at ETHZ and financial support.

As a result, I received an official rejection letter from the migration office (Migrationsamt Z√ºrich), saying I didn‚Äôt cooperate properly or provide enough evidence. They gave me a deadline to leave the country but also said I could file an appeal within 30 days.

I‚Äôm going to submit the full appeal with:
	‚Ä¢	My ETH Z√ºrich enrollment certificate
	‚Ä¢	A signed financial support letter from my parents
	‚Ä¢	A bank attestation proving my father‚Äôs ability to fund my studies

I'm clearly explaining in the letter that it was a mistake on my part, not bad intent, and that I‚Äôve had no issues with migration since I arrived in Switzerland in 2021.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation ‚Äî forgetting to send key documents and successfully appealing?

1jzptji,sour_chili,"Insured with Swisscare as a student ‚Äì now being asked to pay CHF 20,000 to Helsana","Hello everyone

My girlfriend studied in Switzerland from 2019 to 2024 and was covered by Swisscare during that time ‚Äì a digital insurance provider based in Switzerland ‚Äì as a student. After finishing her studies, she switched to Helsana and has now been insured with them for the past 6 months.

Recently, Helsana contacted her and is now requesting an official confirmation that she was exempt from the compulsory Swiss health insurance (KVG) during her studies from 2019 to 2024. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was not aware that such a document existed, and neither Swisscare nor anyone else informed her about this requirement. Supposedly, you need to request this document upon arrival in Switzerland. 

Swisscare has not been helpful in this matter and refers us to the health insurance authority. However, the KVG office informed us that they do not issue retroactive exemption documents and advised us to clarify the issue with Helsana. According to KVG, it should be sufficient to provide proof of valid health insurance during her studies.

Hence, we also spoke to Helsana on the phone, and they confirmed that submitting the insurance certificates from Swisscare via the Helsana portal should be enough. Based on that, we uploaded all relevant documents.

Today, however, we received a message from Helsana stating that they will not accept the proof after all, and are now demanding that we pay retroactive premiums for the entire 4-year period (CHF 400 per month \* 12 months \* 4 years). We are talking about a total amount of around CHF 20,000, which we find outrageous considering the fact that my girlfriend was insured the whole time.

Has anyone had a similar experience or does anyone know a possible solution to this issue?

1m64rve,pricendalis123,Working as dentist from foreign country,"Hello /askswitzerland!

QUESTION/-s

1) Do you feel like there is a shortage of dentists in Switzerland? Does it take like 1-2 months to get appointment when you try to schedule it? I understand it will depend on city you live in but in general this could help me understand the overall picture

2) Are Swiss people welcoming for foreigner to start working in such position? Both employer wise and would you as patient feel comfortable if person working on your teeth isn't Swiss?

3) Maybe you know someone in your life who is a dentist is Switzerland? I tried reaching out to some clinics in Zug and Bern but got 0 responses. Would be great to make some contacts in this field abroad. I was thinking maybe there are some connections between my uni and uni in Bern or Zug but there are non, so I'm on my own.

  
I'd appreciate if you have any other comments in this matter, maybe something I didn't mention or something that is important before I start thinking about this more seriously.

BACKGROUND

I'm a dental student, currently studying in the 3rd year (out of 5) in Lithuania.

For the last year or so I've heard multiple colleagues talk about moving abroad to work- everyone has their own reasoning is it for bigger salary, experience or they simply like the country they'd love to move to.

I've been thinking of possibly moving to Switzerland when I graduate. This means I'd have a diploma in the field of Dentistry that legally allows me to work as dentist in Switzerland.

At the same time I've been reading other subreddits about work situation in Switzerland and it seems like people have trouble finding jobs- I guess it's the same where I'm from but again- everyone's situation is different so it's hard to tell.  

Also the reason why I decided to make this post is that recently there appeared a chance for me to study German for basically the rest of my study period at my uni.

Reasoning for me thinking about working as dentist in Switzerland is: 1) Swiss dentistry is on a very high level and it'd be great experience for me as a dentist 2)from what I understand Swiss people love privacy- it's something I respect and value as well 3)nature- i love hiking, nature, I'm very active sports wise. I lived in some other mountain countries for \~year before and I really enjoyed the aspect of that

I know posts like this have probably been made before, but I didn‚Äôt come across any that matched my situation closely ‚Äî so I figured I‚Äôd ask directly. I hope it‚Äôs not a bother.

I'm from Puerto Rico, currently an associate degree student in Industrial Electromechanics, 28 years old, and I‚Äôve been working at Johnson & Johnson for over 4 years now.

I'm very interested in the possibility of relocating to Switzerland through Johnson & Johnson, especially since I‚Äôve seen that there are several open positions there.( i know that having and being accepted to the positions and getting the permit by the gov and company to actually work there are two different stories)

Ideally, I‚Äôd like to complete my studies first, so I can move(if i have the opportunity)with better preparation and increase my chances of finding a solid opportunity and broader job prospects.

I also want to be transparent about my motivation:
While I understand that Switzerland is not the ""paradise"" some people imagine, and that the cost of living is high, the reality is that in Puerto Rico we also have a high cost of living, but without the benefit of a strong salary structure.

So, for me, moving to a country like Switzerland ‚Äî even with its high living costs ‚Äî would already be a major improvement, since the salaries and opportunities there would offer a much better quality of life compared to my current situation.
(Realistically i have U.S.A as option.....but i don't really like U.S.A)

I wanted to ask ‚Äî how realistic or unrealistic would a move like that be?

For context, I speak Spanish and English fluently, and I know a bit of Japanese. I‚Äôm aware that Switzerland has multiple official languages, with French and German being the most widely spoken depending on the region (or cant√≥n)
That said, learning either language wouldn‚Äôt be an issue at all, and I‚Äôd prioritize learning the one most relevant to the area where I‚Äôd be working or living.

I am a Canadian with C1 French looking to apply to EPFL and UNIGE next year. I have read a lot and it seems the job search is difficult for non-eu/efta persons. I saw however that there is an exception to the precedence rule if you are a graduate from a Swiss university and your field contributes to the scientific or economic interests of Switzerland. As I understand you are also able to count the study years towards a C permit if you held a durable B permit for 2 years.

Knowing this, how difficult would a path like this be?

Start bachelor in life science engineering at EPFL -> 6 months before graduation start looking for work -> take job seeking permit if job not found(Just to try to get a job with bachelors, I know masters is standard in Switzerland)-> start masters if no job found -> look for job 6 months before graduation start looking-> take job seeking permit and hope for best

So knowing the exception to the preference rule,my fluency in a local language and that biotech/life science is a good field in Switzerland, what are my chances of finding a job and remaining in Switzerland after studies?

	‚Ä¢	Quels concours ou s√©lections faut-il passer pour entrer en m√©decine en Suisse ?
	‚Ä¢	Est-ce que c‚Äôest tr√®s difficile d‚Äôy √™tre admis (notamment pour les √©tudiants √©trangers ou venant de France) ?
	‚Ä¢	Comment se d√©roulent les √©tudes (dur√©e, organisation, fili√®res possibles comme chirurgie, gyn√©co, etc.) ?
	‚Ä¢	Est-ce qu‚Äôil y a une diff√©rence importante entre les universit√©s (Lausanne, Gen√®ve, etc.) ?

2. **Les formations et universit√©s**¬†: Auriez-vous des recommandations de formations reconnues‚ÄØ? un livre √† lire au d√©but pour avoir une id√©e?. Je cherche une formation accessible en ligne, avec des professeurs compr√©hensifs car je dois √† travailler en parall√®le, en attendant de valider le Master et de trouver un stage pour m'ouvrir les portes vers le monde professionnel.
3. **Les d√©bouch√©s**¬†: Quels types de m√©tiers sont accessibles dans ce domaine, que je peux exercer sois en Suisse ou USA (je veux travailler √† l'internationale car j'aime beaucoup voyager et d√©couvrir le monde).
4. **Les salaires**¬†pour un d√©butant en Suisse.
5. **Les m√©tiers demand√©s et la diff√©rence entre chacun**¬†: European Affairs Officer in International Relations Division, Analyste en strat√©gie ou relations internationales (en d√©fense, diplomatie, consulting), Consultant en management ou en intelligence √©conomique (secteurs de l‚Äôa√©ronautique, finance, ou d√©fense).

1767um1,SIMPLYSUNDAR,Getting a job after graduation,"Hi. I've got admitted Universit√† della Svizzera italiana's masters in informatics program and I'll start my studies in Feb 2024. 

I know this question is asked a lot, but how hard is it to find a job in the IT/computer science field after graduation? 

I'm not a Swiss nor an EU citizen (from South East Asia). I've done my bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering in 2023 (this year) and have done nearly 10 months software development internship in a medical technology company and got a job as a software engineer in the same company. Have been working there for the past 3-4 months. 

I'm planning to be fluent in at least one of Switzerland's official languages (Italian or German mostly) by the time I graduate from USI. 

Will it be too hard for me to find a job? I know finding jobs in Switzerland as a third country national is hard. But I didn't get any info on getting a job after studying here.

‚Ä¢Exchange programmes: ETH has much more top tier options such as MIT, Princeton, NUS, NUT...

‚Ä¢Internships: In ETH are hard to get because exams are in summer, but I don't actually think that that will be really relevant because I already have experience in IT industry and because internship at EFPL will be like 2 months long so there no much time to actually take profit of it.

‚Ä¢City; I've been in Zurich a couple times and I love it it's where I want to live in the long run, but at the same time because of that I might want to live in other places before settling down also I've heard that Lausanne has a better student life vibe.

‚Ä¢Master: I've heard that studying at EPFL guarantees you access to masters in EPFL and ETH does not.

‚Ä¢Toughness: I've seen that both of them are pretty much equally challenging being ETH less intense but without vacations and EPFL very intense during semester but with real holidays.

Anyway, here's some feedback (idk if you need to address methodological limitations in your project... if not, then it's probably too late for feedback anyway and you can take these thoughts to your next project.

- I thought the sociodemographic question for ethnicity was very american. This is usually not collected over here unless you specifically address some questions regarding ethnicity. And even when it is... not many native americans over here ;) plus we would probably combine certain categories.

- I'm not sure if I f***ed up myself and didn't read the question precisely enough (I was just getting out of bed earlier when I did this.) But regarding the question on how many time one has voted for certain parties: there's also communal and cantonal votes, not just federal... so just having the answers 0, 1 and 2 is not gonna cut it, since in most cases for a regular voter considering all votes on all levels, there will be much higher numbers than 2.

n3q16io,Internal_Leke,,"C'est pas du d√©nigrement gratuit et sans fondement, c'est une critique objective et r√©aliste d'une approche actuellement limit√©e. 

La critique et la remise en question sont n√©cessaires pour pouvoir avancer dans la recherche. 

Pour les 90%, si tu es curieux tu peux lire la recherche actuelle sur l'""urticaire spontan√© chronique"". L'approche de la m√©decine actuelle en gros c'est: ""Oh non de l'urticaire, c'est balourd comme maladie, on va juste donner des m√©dicaments, inutile de chercher la cause"" (je n'invente pas, c'est √©crit des les guidelines). Si c'est encore l√† apr√®s 6 mois, on commence un traitement au Xolair (10,000+CHF/an en Suisse).

Techniquement ils √©crivent

> Should extended diagnostic measures be per-
formed in chronic spontaneous urticaria?
We recommend for only limited extended diagnostic measures
in chronic spontaneous urticaria based on patient history


Pour les 90%, ils testent surtout la thyro√Øde, des causes immune, c'est √† peu pr√®s 5% des causes. Il y a 50% qui est mis dans la cat√©gorie ""auto immune"", mais c'est plus une hypoth√®se qu'autre chose. 

Mais pourtant il y a des centaines de papiers qui ont identifi√© des causes. Et souvent les solutions traitent d'autres probl√®mes chroniques des patients. 

Une cause tr√®s probable et tr√®s courante est une inflammation intestinale chronique caus√©e par une bact√©rie (non sp√©cifique, des dizaines de bact√©ries diff√©rentes donnent lieu aux membres r√©sultats).

Le souci de la m√©decine, ils regardent les bact√©ries une par une, et concluent que √ßa ne d√©finit pas la maladie... Tout en confirmant qu'√©radiquer les bact√©ries peut conduire √† une r√©mission

> HP infection is common among the general population, but only some of the infected patients show CSU, and patients with CSU are not necessarily infected by HP.

> Indeed, there are some reports of patients in CSU remission after every HP eradication

https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/html/10.2340/00015555-1373

Sauf que HP c'est seulement une parmi les dizaines (centaines) de bact√©ries pouvant g√©n√©rer une inflammation de l'intestin. 

Ce que je sugg√®re? Pour quelqu'un qui souffre actuellement de ce genre de probl√®me : aller voir des th√©rapeutes, m√™me pas super qualifi√©s (e.g. naturopathe) qui pourront les guider vers un traitement, ou avoir le chance de trouver un m√©decin qui a lu des  recherches r√©centes (c'est rare).

Pour le m√©decine Suisse: importer le test qui n'existe actuellement qu'aux Etats Unis pour pouvoir tester √ßa, et autoriser les m√©dicaments pour traiter ce genre de maladies.

Pour la m√©decine mondiale: des tests de chaque partie du corps jusqu'√† trouver l'inflammation (des patients ont eu des r√©missions apr√®s avoir enlev√© un minuscule corps √©tranger dans un orteil, ou apr√®s avoir commenc√© un traitement avec un spray nasal st√©ro√Ødien). 

Bref, l'urticaire n'est qu'un exemple, mais d√®s qu'on creuse sur une pathologie on voit qu'en fait on en connait tr√®s peu, et que des fois des traitements parall√®les peuvent taper l√† o√π la m√©decine n'ose pas aller",suisse,√©tudier en Suisse,1,https://reddit.com/r/suisse/comments/1m22nkd/suisje_le_seul_agac√©_par_le_traitement_positif/n3q16io/,1752794531.0,comment,fr,0.9753587245941162,"This is not a free and unsubstantiated denial.

n2wj9es,categorie,,"> Le prix est naturellement li√© √† la taille de la population. Si il n'y avait pas d'habitants et personne qui ne voulait venir ici, le prix serait de 0. Je vous renvoie aux notions d'offre et de demande.

Sauf que la demande en logement est li√©e a l'offre d'emploi. C'est la premi√®re raison poussant les gens a s'installer dans une r√©gion ou une ville donn√©e. Au cours des 25 derni√®re ann√©es a Gen√®ve, le prix de l'immobilier a augment√© de 150%. La population et le nombre d'emploi lui, de seulement 25%. C'est une preuve que bien qu'il existe un lien entre taille de la population et prix de l'immobilier, il est loin, tr√®s loin d'√™tre le facteur d√©terminant.

Le fait (comme tu le soulignes) qu'une grande partie du march√© immobilier soit concentr√© aux seins d'investisseurs (fonds de pensions ou autres) partageant un int√©r√™t commun primordial - la rentabilit√© de leur investissement - est une des raisons principales pour lesquelles l'immobilier ne peux pas √™tre √©tudi√© s√©rieusement sous le prisme na√Øf de l'offre et de la demande.

EDIT: Le simple fait qu'un investisseur ait la possibilit√© d'acheter un bien immobilier gonfle artificiellement la demande, puisqu'il rentre en concurrence avec des personnes qui ont r√©ellement besoin d'habiter l√†. Dans un canton comme Gen√®ve ou seulement 18% des habitants sont locataires, on se rend bien compte de l'impact d√©sastreux sur le prix de l'immobilier et de l'√©vidence de la proposition de bannir l'investissement locatif.",suisse,√©tudier en suisse pour les africains,6,https://reddit.com/r/suisse/comments/1lysvl2/estce_quil_y_a_une_solution_r√©aliste_√†_la_crise/n2wj9es/,1752417101.0,comment,fr,0.991599440574646,"> The price is naturally related to the size of the population. If there were no inhabitants and no one who wanted to come here, the price would be 0. I refer you to the notions of supply and demand. Except that the demand for housing is linked to the offer of employment. This is the first reason pushing people to settle in a given region or city. Over the last 25 years in Geneva, the price of real estate has increased by 150%. The population and the number of jobs it has, by only 25%. This is proof that although there is a connection between population size and real estate prices, it is far from being the determining factor. The fact (as you underline) that a large part of the real estate market is concentrated on the breasts of investors (pension funds or others) sharing a primary common interest - the profitability of their investment - is one of the main reasons why the real estate cannot be seriously studied under the na√Øve prism of supply and demand.

1. Io vorrei lavorare nel segmento IT di qualche banca/fondo/assicurazione o comunque vorrei sviluppare software per questi enti, siete a conoscenza di opportunit√† di lavoro vicino Lugano in questo campo? √® ragionevole pensare di trovare lavoro in zona? 
2. Vorrei vivere in Svizzera e non fare il frontaliere, perch√® lo reputo un comportamento molto scorretto ed in seguito vorrei prendere anche la cittadinanza (ho letto che ci vogliono una decina d'anni, ma non credo sia un problema), √® possibile permettersi una casa a prezzi umani o ci sono prezzi assurdi come in Lombardia? (Anche in periferia va bene)
3. C'√® una qualche borsa di studio che mi agevolerebbe all'inizio? Il master costa 16k franchi ed io non sono esattamente ricco. Inoltre l'universit√† permette di lavorare soltanto 15 ore a settimana mentre si frequenta, quindi non avrei molta libert√† di fare universit√†-lavoro come faccio adesso.
4. In generale com'√® trovare lavoro, soprattutto nel settore dell'educazione? La mia ragazza √® laureata in scienze della formazione e ovviamente mi seguirebbe. 
5. Come sono visti gli italiani?

Attualmente in classe fai conto che 2/3 del corpo studentesco (almeno, per il mio bachelor in economia. Per i corsi master c‚Äô√® tantissima gente che proviene un po‚Äô da tutto il mondo) sono italiani. Quando chiedevo come mai hanno scelto l‚ÄôUSI se dopotutto in Italia ci sono comunque, a mio parere, universit√† ben rinomate, buona parte delle volte la loro motivazione √® stata ‚ÄúNon hai idea di quanto possa valere un diploma svizzero in Italia!‚Äù.

Ho avuto molti amici che si sono diplomati da diverse universit√† in Svizzera che ora sono, per esempio, nel mondo della finanza o del consulting.

Certo, fare il programma completamente in inglese potrebbe aiutarti, SPERANDO CHE i docenti cambino, dato che dai loro accenti non si capisce una mazza) o il peso che si d√† alle note: molti dei miei amici che ora lavorano, spesso mi consigliano di avere note elevate, essendo un netto vantaggio per una scuola come l‚ÄôUSI. Devi sapere che comunque, tutto sommato, a livello qualitativo √® una delle peggiori (ho visto dell‚Äôincredibile qui a livello di esami, che non ho mai e poi mai pensato che avrei potuto vedere nel corso del mio percorso) in Svizzera, quindi per ‚Äòrifarti‚Äô dovresti perlomeno avere note abbastanza buone.",Ticino,studiare in svizzera universit√†,5,https://reddit.com/r/Ticino/comments/1c1hxec/pareri_usi/kz4tmcv/,1712868092.0,comment,it,0.994211733341217,"I'll tell you, I'm a USI student and I'm just studying economy, with stream in management.

1j83alf,Indecisa_1004,Surviving in Basel with a part-time job as an international MSc student.,"
I am planning to start a MSc at Basel University in September. I am a EU citizen and have been living in Switzerland (although in a different canton) for over 2 years already, the last year and a half on a B permit.

- I am struggling to find clear information on the permits regulations in my case (should I apply for a new permit, or can I keep my current permit and therefore start working immediately? Do I have the 15 hrs/week restriction anyway as a EU citizen with B permit? If anyone with the same experience could share their knowledge that would be extremely useful). 

- to the main question: once I finally start working, considering I can only work part-time I accounted for a netto salary of about 1200.-/1400.- . Is that realistic? (I would try for research assistant in some Molecular biology lab and if not that would go back to hospitality. I know some basic German and fluent in French and Italian, with fine dining experience).

I am planning to start a MSc at Basel University in September. I am a EU citizen and have been living in Switzerland (although in a different canton) for over 2 years already, the last year and a half on a B permit.

- I am struggling to find clear information on the permits regulations in my case (should I apply for a new permit, or can I keep my current permit and therefore start working immediately? Do I have the 15 hrs/week restriction anyway as a EU citizen with B permit? If anyone with the same experience could share their knowledge that would be extremely useful). 

- to the main question: once I finally start working, considering I can only work part-time I accounted for a netto salary of about 1200.-/1400.- . Is that realistic? (I would try for research assistant in some Molecular biology lab and if not that would go back to hospitality. I know some basic German and fluent in French and Italian, with fine dining experience).

10rjd76,Kozure_Ookami,Questions about Application of MSc in Chemistry in Universit√§t Basel,"Hello r/basel I am from Hong Kong and want to get into MSc in Chemistry, but I have a few things that I want to ask:

1. Is my grade good enough? I have a GPA of 3.25/4.3 in my bachelors of science in chemistry from a university in Hong Kong, which according [to this formula](https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Application-Admission/Admission/Conversion-and-calculation-of-final-grade.html) can be converted to 5.4 in the Swiss university grading system.
2. According to [the required document](https://www.unibas.ch/dam/jcr:08731250-b45d-4fa3-9368-855a5b6a9b4e/Information%20sheet%20documents%20application%20master%20foreign_HS23.pdf), statement/letter of motivation is not needed outside of a few specific masters. But should I still upload one into the online application system to increase my chance of admission?
3. For all digital documents I upload, do I need to upload a certified true copy or I only need to upload a scanned file of my original copy?
4.

1. Is my grade good enough? I have a GPA of 3.25/4.3 in my bachelors of science in chemistry from a university in Hong Kong, which according [to this formula](https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Application-Admission/Admission/Conversion-and-calculation-of-final-grade.html) can be converted to 5.4 in the Swiss university grading system.
2. According to [the required document](https://www.unibas.ch/dam/jcr:08731250-b45d-4fa3-9368-855a5b6a9b4e/Information%20sheet%20documents%20application%20master%20foreign_HS23.pdf), statement/letter of motivation is not needed outside of a few specific masters. But should I still upload one into the online application system to increase my chance of admission?
3. For all digital documents I upload, do I need to upload a certified true copy or I only need to upload a scanned file of my original copy?

My girlfriend and I are non-EU citizens (mexicans), but we are currently in the netherlands finishing a masters, My  girlfriend got the chance to make a  paid PhD in Switzerland. Our plan is to move there and for me to eventually find a job there at least for the duration of her PhD (after that we will see what happens). 

Do any of you had a similar situation or know what should I do ( in terms of which VISA to go for) in order for me to be able to live there with her?

We have some significant savings, so if asked we could be able to prove I can live there for a while. We also both have a resident permit for living in the netherlands.

I am also in touch with the Swiss embassy, and have read that maybe the easiest way is to get married and apply for the family reunification visa, but we are still wondering if anyone knows of a similar case and can provide their personal experience, or they have any suggestions?

Hi Everyone, 

I'm a student from Australia who will be doing a short course of study at the University of Lausanne from the 27th of January to the 15th of February. I just wanted to reach out to you all for some advice on how to best dress for the weather. Coming from Australia I don't really have a good gage of cold weather so any advice would be welcome. Particularly concerning shoes, would you suggest getting proper winter boots or would normal hiking boots suffice?

I would also welcome any suggestions or ideas on what to do in my free time whilst there, I'm really excited to visit the city (and Switzerland) and I'm keen to take advantage of the opportunity.

\-Currently work in a bike shop part time/50%/20 hours per week (I recently finished my degree, still waiting for the paperwork)

\-minor experience in IT (we did some programming in physics)

Ideally I would like a job in the physics/natural sciences/IT sector and going back to bike mechanic would be the least desirable option.

1kpfssl,Rough_Owl_7843,Looking into University of Bern for CSE ‚Äì Need Insights (International Student),"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm currently exploring my options to continue a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science/Engineering in English. I recently came across the University of Bern in Switzerland. My parents are relocating to Vevey from India due to a job transfer, so I‚Äôm considering moving there too.

I‚Äôve completed my first year of BTech/BCS from an H+ recognized college, so I believe I now meet the 13 years of education requirement for Swiss universities.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in knowing:
	‚Ä¢	How is the University of Bern for Computer Science, especially in terms of the job market after graduation?
	‚Ä¢	Are there good postgraduate (Master‚Äôs) opportunities either within Switzerland or elsewhere in Europe after finishing a CS degree from Bern?
	‚Ä¢	Is English-taught CSE at Bern common, or would I need to learn German soon?

If anyone has experience with the University of Bern or the Swiss higher education system as an international student, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance!

mwainhp,BioinformaticsGirlie,,"Landlords ask for proof of income and typically the apartment you live in should not exceed 1/3 of your wage. Otherwise it's pretty hard to get it. 
I would say it takes a couple of weeks to finalize everything with the student lodge. I recommend doing it a month ahead just to be safe. A lot of ppl book them, so the later you book the less availability it will have. If your budget is up to 1k, definitely get a studio in the student lodge. That's what I would do if I didn't have a dog (pets aren't allowed in the lodge so I just live in a normal studio in Bern rn). 
In any case, I think it's safer to get a room in the student lodge than renting a room in an apartment with other ppl. Student lodge is pretty safe. But that's just my opinion.

Questions:

* Are there any scholarships, or if not, what are the possibilities for work?
   * I already have quite experience so will be able to find a job relatively quickly.
* Is there a mandatory fixed amount that you need to have in your account in order to be granted a student visa ?
* I plan to live in Lausanne because of the costs. Is this doable, or will I need to play a lot for commuting?
* Is the university competitive in this sector ?

 **Deux ans apr√®s avoir choqu√© Bruxelles en d√©cidant brutalement de mettre fin √† de longues ann√©es de n√©gociations, le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, a annonc√© qu'un mandat de n√©gociation avec l'UE serait pr√™t ¬´¬†avant la fin de l'ann√©e¬†¬ª. Comment expliquer cette volont√© de Berne de vouloir renouer les liens avec l'Union europ√©enne ? Ce rapprochement intervient au moment o√π le pr√©sident fran√ßais Emmanuel Macron doit se rendre en Suisse les 15 et 16 novembre prochain.** **Analyse.** 

[ Image du pr√©sident Alain Berset de la Conf√©d√©ration suisse le 19 octobre 2018 √† Bruxelles  ](https://preview.redd.it/5wckisr6phzb1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=41d7c7487f9c326e589d32e9611f71371dbb712e)

Est-ce le d√©but de la fin d'une longue crise entre l'Union europ√©enne et la Suisse ? En 2021, la Suisse avait mis fin aux n√©gociations de l'accord-cadre avec Bruxelles. Cet accord devait r√©gir les relations entre la Conf√©d√©ration et l'Union sur des domaines aussi larges que la recherche scientifique, la question des travailleurs d√©tach√©s ou la r√©glementation financi√®re ou la question plus sensible de la libre circulation des personnes.

L'√©conomie suisse est tr√®s int√©gr√©e au march√© unique. Il faut reprendre le chemin de la n√©gociation.

**Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.**

Faute d'accord entre les diff√©rentes formations politiques en Suisse m√™me, Berne avait quitt√© la table des n√©gociations. Deux ans plus tard, l'heure est de nouveau au dialogue. Des n√©gociations technique entre Berne et Bruxelles selon la RTS (Radio t√©l√©vision suisse) ont repris au plus haut niveau d√®s avril 2022. Ces premi√®res discussions portaient sur de nouveaux accords dans le domaine de l'√©lectricit√©, de la r√©glementation financi√®re ou du programme europ√©en de recherche Horizon.

## √âchec des n√©gociations en 2021

Selon Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve et sp√©cialiste des relations entre l'Union europ√©enne et la Suisse, Berne n'avait pas le choix. *""L'√©conomie suisse est tr√®s int√©gr√©e au march√© unique, bien plus d'autres pays qui ne sont pas dans l'Union europ√©enne comme le Royaume-Uni. Il faut reprendre le chemin de la n√©gociation"",* explique Ren√© Schwok. Plus de 69% des importations de la Suisse viennent des pays membres de l'Union europ√©enne. Et 50% des exportations suisses sont √† destination de l'Union europ√©enne selon la Mission de la Suisse aupr√®s de l'UE.

[**Lire : Suisse, un mandat de n√©gociations avec l'UE pr√™t ""avant la fin de l'ann√©e""**](https://information.tv5monde.com/international/suisse-un-mandat-de-negociations-avec-lue-pret-avant-la-fin-de-lannee-2674847)

L'Union europ√©enne en 2021 a pris des mesures contre la Suisse suite √† l'√©chec des n√©gociations sur l'accord- cadre.

*""Deux d'entres elles ont un impact sur l'√©conomie suisse. Le projet Horizon est un programme de d√©veloppement de la recherche universitaire et scientifique en Europe. Les universit√©s suisses et les centres de recherche suisses sont exclus de ce programme. Ce n'est pas le cas de pays comme l'Albanie ou le Royaume-Uni qui ne font pas partie de l'Union europ√©enne. C'est un vrai probl√®me car cela peut entrainer une fuite des cerveaux du pays. Et une perte de comp√©titivit√© pour le pays""*, explique Ren√© Schwok.

L'Union europ√©enne a mis en place une autre mesure en r√©ponse √† la fin des n√©gociations de 2021.¬† Elle concerne les *""obstacles techniques au commerce"".*

Ce sont des normes qui r√©gissent l‚Äôexportation ou l'importation de produits. La Suisse avait mis en place des accords pour √©viter ces obstacles techniques au commerce. En clair, il s'agissait de permettre aux produits suisses d'√™tre export√©s facilement sans faire face √† des probl√®mes de normes propres au march√© europ√©en. L'Union europ√©enne remet aujourd'hui en cause cette facilit√©.

*""Les contr√¥les techniques sur les produits suisses ont √©t√© r√©tablis. La Suisse exporte beaucoup de machine-outil et, de m√©dicaments via son industrie pharmaceutique. Le secteur suisse du mat√©riel m√©dical d√©pend √©galement du march√© europ√©en. Cette mesure p√©nalise l'√©conomie suisse et ses exportations vers le march√© unique"",* d√©crit  Ren√© Schwok, sp√©cialiste des relations entre la Suisse et l'Union europ√©enne.

## Recherche du consensus

Le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, est favorable √† une reprise des n√©gociations avec l'Union europ√©enne. Mais trouvera-t-il un consensus politique dans ce sens ?

En 2021, Berne avait d√©cid√© de mettre fin au projet d'accord cadre √† cause des dissension internes en Suisse. *""Les n√©gociations buttent souvent sur des questions internes. Lorsque le gouvernement est confront√© √† une trop forte opposition il abandonne le projet. Il y a en Suisse une culture du consensus politique"",* explique Ren√© Schwok, professeur √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

*Les relations entre la France et la Suisse se sont fortement refroidies lorsque la Conf√©d√©ration, au m√©pris de toute consid√©ration strat√©gique, a d√©cid√© d'acheter des avions de combat am√©ricain, les F35, au d√©triment d'un avion europ√©en, le Rafale fran√ßais.*

**Pascal Sciarini , professeur de Sciences politques √† l'Universit√© de Geneve.**

*""Les n√©gociations se jouent donc √† deux niveaux. D'abord avec l'Union europ√©enne, et¬†ensuite il faut n√©gocier √† l‚Äôint√©rieur du pays avec les formations politiques ou avec les syndicats. La gauche essaie de marchander son soutien. Les syndicats √©galement. L'UDC (*droite conservatrice hostile √† l'Union europ√©enne*) dit non par principe. Le Conseil f√©d√©ral n'a pas la m√™me marge de man≈ìuvre que le pr√©sident fran√ßais"",* d√©crit Ren√© Schwok.

Pascal Sciarini, professeur de Sciences politiques √† l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Gen√®ve abonde dans le m√™me sens. *""En Suisse on cherche √† construire des coalitions larges. On ne raisonne pas en terme de camp politique contre un autre. Les n√©gociations pourraient reprendre parce qu'une coalition a pu se construire et a pu isoler l'UDC sur cette question europ√©enne"",* confirme le professeur en Sciences politiques.

Le pr√©sident Emmanuel Macron doit se rendre ce 15 novembre en Suisse et rencontrer Alain Berset, le Pr√©sident de la Conf√©d√©ration suisse. Selon Marc Ferraci d√©put√© de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle et proche d'Emmanuel Macron, dans un entretien donn√© √† la Tribune de Gen√®ve le 6 novembre dernier cette visite doit servir √† *""r√©affirmer la profondeur des liens""* entre la Suisse et la France.

## Une √©conomie int√©gr√©e √† l'Union europ√©enne

*""Les relations entre la France et la Suisse se sont fortement refroidies lorsque la Conf√©d√©ration au m√©pris de toute consid√©ration strat√©gique a d√©cid√© d'acheter des avions de combat am√©ricains, les F35, au d√©triment d'un avion europ√©en, le Rafale fran√ßais. Cet √©pisode a fortement irrit√© les Fran√ßais"",* explique Pascal Sciarini , professeur de Sciences politiques √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

*""Le Conseil f√©d√©ral aujourd‚Äôhui veut renouer les liens avec l'Union europ√©enne et dans ce cadre-l√† le gouvernement suisse veut avoir de bonnes relations inter-√©tatiques avec des pays membres de l'Union europ√©enne. La France est un pays membre de l'Union europ√©enne. M√™me si de fait c'est la Commission qui d√©cidera de l‚Äôissue des n√©gociations, on cherche avoir un canal de n√©gociations inter √©tatiques"",* ajoute Pascal Sciarini, professeur de sciences politiques √† l'Universit√© de Gen√®ve.

Le processus de n√©gociation ne fait que commencer. En marge de ses discussions avec l'Union europ√©enne, le Conseil f√©d√©ral, le gouvernement suisse, a entam√© des discussions avec les syndicats. Ces derniers d√©noncent une lib√©ralisation du mod√®le suisse sur la protection des salaires.
